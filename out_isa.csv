españolseven new applications for approval of plans of work for exploration in the international seabed area were approved this morning by the council of the international seabed authority as it nears conclusion of its work of the twentieth session in kingston.
also this morning, the council took note of the report of the secretary-general, nii  allotey odunton (ghana), concerning the credentials of members of the council. in other matters, the council continued discussions on guidelines and procedures it would recommend to its expert body, the legal and technical commission, for the extension of  contracts for exploration of minerals in the area by investors whose contracts are due to expire in the next few years.
three plans of work were approved for exploration for polymetallic nodules to be carried out by united kingdom seabed resources ltd , ocean mineral singapore pte ltd, and the cook islands investment corporation. the report and recommendations of the legal and technical commission for these three applicants are contained in documents isba/20/c/5; isba/20/c/7, and isba/20/c/18 respectively.
two applications, from the government of india (isba/20/c/6) and the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources of germany (bgr) (isba/20/c/16) were approved for exploration for polymetallic sulphides.  the remaining two applications were submitted for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts by the ministry of natural resources and environment of the russian federation (isba/20/c/4) and companhia de pesquisa de recursos minerais, a brazilian entity (isba/20/c/17).
the procedure for consideration by the legal and technical commission of applications for plans of work for exploration in the area are identical in the regulations covering each mineral. in considering a proposed plan of work for exploration, the commission is required to take into account the principles, policies and objectives relating to activities in the area as provided for in part xi and annex iii of the united nations convention on the law of the sea and the 1994 agreement on the implementation of part xi (seabed mining provisions) of the convention.
discussion
nigeria cautioned about the fact that some of the applicants already had existing contracts but their level of performance or capability had not yet been assessed by the authority.
with regard to the application of the ocean mineral singapore pte ltd, argentina noted with concern that the commission<U+0092>s report did not identify the name of the affiliate which may enter into a management services agreement with the applicant.  the representative was of the view that such information should be specified in the application. chile endorsed the position.
germany pointed out that the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources had made amendments to its original application which modified the area under application. those amendments were needed because its application area overlapped with that applied for by the government of india. the representative said that such problems were likely to occur again because prospective applicants had no knowledge of the areas requested by others.  the representative suggested that the commission could look into ways to rectify them. the comment drew support from france and the united kingdom.
a number of delegations expressed satisfaction with the progress made by the approval of the seven new plans of work in the area.  fiji and jamaica noted that several developing countries would be among the new contractors as was envisioned in article 148 of the  convention. senegal noted that the <U+0093>grand dream<U+0094> of converting the resources of the ocean into the wealth of mankind was closer to becoming a reality.  cameroon said the progress confirmed the wisdom and foresight of those who <U+0093>tirelessly worked to craft and adopt the convention.<U+0094>
representatives of the seven prospective contractors expressed appreciation to the council and the commission and affirmed their commitment to fulfil their obligations to the authority.  russia said included in its plans were guidelines to ensure effective preservation of the marine environment and a training programme.  the united kingdom said it took great care in reviewing the work plan of uk seabed resources limited, applying the highest standards of environmental protection.  the representative of singapore said that his country had a sound reputation of good governance and was in the process of developing robust legislation to govern deep seabed activities.
proposal on extension of exploratory contracts
the delegation of brazil submitted a proposal to the council on guidelines and procedures for the implementation of regulations relating to the extension of plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules in the seabed area.
the  document states that  in the interest of fairness, the council might wish to authorise a provisional extension  of up to six months to those contracts that expire in 2016 to allow contractors to prepare their submissions for extension, if they so wish.
in the event that an exploitation code was not available by the time a contractor attested to its willingness and capacity to proceed to the exploitation stage, as confirmed by the legal and technical commission, the document says the contract in question would be awarded a provisional extension of no more than two years, as specified in article 15 (b) of section 1 of the annex to the 1994 agreement.
noting that any request for extension was not an automatic renewal of an existing contract of exploration, but rather <U+0093>akin to a new application that should be conducive to a contract of exploitation<U+0094>, brazil<U+0092>s document states that the following procedures should apply:

the proposal should be preceded by a detailed explanation by the contractor of the reasons why an extension is requested and the length of time required, to a maximum of five years;


the proposal should take the form of an application that outlines the work  that would be undertaken to enable the contractor to proceed to the exploitation stage, including a detailed plan of work for each year of extension;


the proposal should also highlight what changes in the terms and conditions of the existing contract the contractor wishes to make;


the sponsoring state must extend the certificate of sponsorship for the period of extension requested;


the payment of a fee that covers the costs incurred by the authority in assessing the proposal, as well as an annual overhead charge to cover the costs of supervision; the amount of such fee and overhead charge should be determined by the finance committee and presented to the council  at its 2015 session. 

the brazil document earlier notes that the council might wish to provide the secretary-general and the legal and technical commission with general guidance on the basis of the following elements <U+0096> taking into account views expressed during the debate on the subject <U+0096> either by adopting it or by an understanding to be provided in a report of its chairman.
the document states that the commission should consider the following general principles and standards for the preparation of draft procedures and criteria for applicants for extensions of contracts for exploration:

the pertinent principles governing the area, as contained in part xi, section 2 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, in particular those contained in  articles 139 (responsibility to ensure compliance and liability for damage), 143 (marine scientific research), 145 (protection of the marine environment), 146 (protection of human life) and 148 (participation of developing states in the activities in the area) of the convention;


article 153 (system of exploration and exploitation) of the convention, in particular its paragraphs 4,5 and 6;


article 189 (limitation of jurisdiction with regard to decisions of the authority) of the convention;


article 300 (good faith and abuse of rights) of the convention.

according to brazil<U+0092>s document, the periodic reviews of implementation of each plan of work should have provided for an evaluation, over the first ten years of each individual contract, of the implementation of the plan of work and of the stage in which each contractor was in terms of the necessary preparatory work for proceeding to the exploitation stage, as well as provided for any adjustment related to any circumstances confronted by each contractor, including those beyond its control.
as regards the interpretation of the prevailing economic circumstances that might not justify proceeding to the exploitation stage, the document observes that it is hard not to agree with the secretariat that <U+0091>if after 15 years a particular contractor<U+0092>s project is not viable for reasons that are unconnected to global economic conditions, it seems difficult to understand why an extension for a further five years is justified<U+0092>.
the document adds that it is worth considering only what criteria should be applied to judge the economic feasibility of each individual contract to proceed to the exploitation phase in no more than five years. it observes that the extension of each individual contract may require the revision of its terms and conditions as the authority and the contractor may agree in accordance with the regulations, as provided for under section 3.2 of the standard clauses.
at this afternoon<U+0092>s meeting, the council will discuss the issues relating to the extension of exploration contracts in light of the proposal put forward by brazil.tweets by isbahq",2021-04-08

españoljamaica, kingston (29 january 2016) - - the first periodic review of the manner in which the international regime for the area has operated in practice has commenced.  the review is being carried out pursuant to article 154 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea.
article 154 requires the assembly of the authority, every five years from the entry into force of the convention, to undertake a general and systemic review of the manner in which the authority has operated in practice and to recommend measures which will lead to the improvement of its operation. the authority is undertaking the review in a systematic manner for the first time after twenty-two years of the authority<U+0092>s existence.
during its 21st session in 2015, the assembly appointed a review committee to oversee the overall conduct of the review. the committee is chaired by former judge of the international tribunal on the law of the sea and current president of the assembly, ambassador helmut tuerk of austria. at its first meeting in january 2016, the committee appointed seascape consultants ltd, a uk-based consultancy firm, to assist the committee to conduct the review by carrying out a background study according to the terms of reference agreed by the assembly. 
ambassador tuerk said that according to its terms of reference, the exercise would involve a review of the level of representation and attendance of members of the authority at its regular annual sessions; an analysis of the performance of the assembly as the supreme organ of the authority; an analysis of the performance of the council as the executive organ of the authority; and a review of the structure of the secretariat and of the performance of its functions including its performance of the functions of the enterprise pursuant to paragraph 5 of section 1 of the annex to the 1994 agreement. the review would also require a review of the performance, level of representation and attendance of members of the subsidiary organs of the authority, together with an analysis of the current and projected workload and the identification of measures that may lead to an improvement of their operations.
professor david johnson, head of the seascape consultants<U+0092> team, said that their approach towards the conduct of the review would include the widely used institutional and organisational assessment model that enables assessment of performance based on key drivers namely: external environment, organisational capacity, and organisational motivation. professor johnson added that the key inputs to the review would include intensive reviews of the authority<U+0092>s official documents, conduct of workshops, analysis of questionnaires by member states, contractors and observers and the conduct of structured interviews with key stakeholders, using a regional approach. team members include phil weaver and vikki gunn of seascape, wylie spicer qc and sara mahaney of mcinnes cooper, a legal firm based in canada,  dr. angel perez of universidade do vale do itajaí, brazil, akuila tawake, secretariat of the pacific community and dr dire tladi, a member of the international law commission and a professor at the university of pretoria, south africa.
further information and links to the questionnaires prepared by seascape for the conduct of the review will be disseminated by the secretary-general of the authority to its members and observers in due course. other stakeholders will also be invited to provide their input. the due date for submission of questionnaires is 26 february 2016.
an interim report is expected to be considered by the assembly at its 22nd session in july 2016 with the final report to be submitted in 2017.

españoljamaica, kingston  (18 march 2015) - -  african states were encouraged to make all possible efforts to overcome constraints to participate in the sessions of the authority to ensure the voices of africa were properly heard and interests properly safeguarded and promoted. 
speaking at the seminar on exploration and exploitation of deep seabed minerals resources in the area : challenges for africa, the deputy to the secretary-general of the international seabed authority, michael lodge paid tribute to the 1974 declaration of the organization of african unity on issues of the law of the sea in which african states reaffirmed their belief in the principle of the common heritage, including the need to distribute equitably among all developing countries the proceeds from any financial levies imposed on deep seabed mining, to protect the marine environment, and give full meaning to the concept of the common heritage of mankind.
at the same time, mr lodge also expressed concern over the lack of participation by african states in recent years especially with the 26 deep sea exploration contracts approved by the authority, 14 were with contractors sponsored by the asia-pacific states, 7 with contractors sponsored by western european states, 4 with contractors sponsored by eastern european states and 1 by the group of latin american and caribbean states. no application sponsored by an african state has yet been received.  
mr lodge said african states participation was particularly acute at this time as the authority has entered into the crucial task of preparing the rules and regulations for future exploitation of deep sea minerals. the successful completion of the exploitation code could not be done without the effective participation of the african countries.
also speaking at the seminar, the honourable deputy minister for mineral resources of the republic of south africa, mr. godfrey oliphant said south africa was privileged to play a part in assisting the authority in its outreach and informing relevant stakeholders of its crucial mandate and important work in strengthening the multilateral processes for the governance of the world<U+0092>s oceans.
mr oliphant said the marine environment was particularly important to africa and its people. as the second biggest continent, africa<U+0092>s coastline is over 26 000 nautical miles with the 38 african countries either coastal or island states. 
he said african countries needed to take up their rightful place, not only in the work of the authority, but also in sharing the potential benefits of mineral exploitation in the international seabed, as well as in relevant marine research projects and results. he continued that it was also important to be fully aware of the opportunities for capacity building and technology transfer provided by contractors as part of their obligations for mineral exploration in the international deep seabed, as well as by the authority<U+0092>s endowment fund for marine scientific research.
the seminar is being held in tshwane, south africa from 17-19 march and is the ninth sensitization seminar to be convened by the international seabed authority in different countries around the world, and the second to be held on the continent of africa. 
these seminars are an important means of outreach for the authority to inform the countries of the region and the various ministries and departments in the host country of the work of the authority and other related international institutions, the latest developments in deep seabed mining and other topics of relevance.

españolthe council of the international seabed authority, meeting in kingston this morning, adopted a twelve-paragraph decision on the summary report of the chair of the legal and technical commission which was presented at its 17 july meeting.
revised from a 32-paragraph document submitted by brazil on the basis of comments and contributions by members of the council, the draft decision (isba/20/c/l.10) is a streamlined consensus text formulated during informal group consultations on monday, 21 july.
brazil, who thanked delegations for helping to produce a more concise document for the council to adopt, recommended that the paragraphs left out from the previous draft could be included in a report to the assembly by the president of the council <U+0096> a point on which other delegations agreed. france said it would allow the decision to go forward but felt there were some paragraphs that were more suited for the president<U+0092>s report.
the decision reads as follows:
 by the draft decision, the council requested the commission <U+0093>as a matter of urgency and as its priority<U+0094> to formulate draft procedures and criteria for applications for extension of contracts for exploration, to be submitted to the council at its 2015 session, in accordance with section 3.2 of the standard clauses contained in annex 4 to the regulations. this was to be applied in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner to all requests for extension of contracts for exploration. the commission<U+0092>s text was to be made available in advance of the council<U+0092>s 2015 session.
the council took note, with appreciation, of the summary report of the chair of the commission on its work during the twentieth session and requested the commission to continue its elaboration of the exploitation regulations as a matter of priority. a draft framework was to be made available to all members of the authority and all stakeholders as soon as possible after the commission<U+0092>s february 2015 meeting.
the commission was requested to consider, as appropriate, the submission by
the netherlands on environmental management plans and environmental impact assessments in the regulatory framework for mineral exploitation in the area (isba/20/c/13) in the context of its work on the preparation of draft regulations for exploitation in the area.
by the text, the council called the attention of contractors to the issues raised and recommendations made by the commission on their annual reports.
the commission was asked to examine ways to ensure that training opportunities effectively considered the interests and needs of developing states, particularly the landlocked and geographically disadvantaged among them, in accordance with article 148 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, and recommendations on training programmes embodied in plans of work of contractors and sponsoring states.
the council requested the commission to continue to work on issues related to the sponsorship by states of exploration contracts in the area, with particular attention to a test of effective control, as well as with issues related to monopolization of activities in the area, considering, in particular, the concept of abuse of a dominant position.
furthermore, the council requested the commission to submit for its approval, not later than its 2016 session, draft procedures on the handling of confidential data and information, as provided for in rule 12 of its own rules of procedure. its secretariat was encouraged to continue their work, up to and beyond 2015, on the implementation of the environmental management plan for the clarion-clipperton zone.
the commission was encouraged to consider developing environmental management plans in other international seabed area zones, in particular where there were currently exploration contracts, in line with the suggestion by the united nations general assembly in paragraph 51 of its resolution 68/70.  all contractors were encouraged to make their environmental data readily and publicly available.
the commission was asked to continue exploring initiatives to increase transparency and dialogue on the development of its work, in particular on issues of general interest to member states and other stakeholders of the authority.
finally, the council also requested the secretary-general to ensure that adequate time and resources continued to be made available to support the commission<U+0092>s work, especially on priority issues.
the representative of the netherlands drew attention to the statement of the president of the council of the international seabed authority on the work of the council during the nineteenth session (isba/19/c/18). paragraph 17 of the report read, in part:
the council further requested the legal and technical commission to review the provisions of the three sets of regulations relating to the monopolization of activities in the area and the option of offering an equity interest in a joint venture arrangement with a view to aligning all three sets of regulations in this respect, and to make a recommendation thereon for consideration by the council at its twentieth session in 2014.
the netherlands said the council could either add this request as a paragraph in the current draft decision or the president could ask the commission to report on the matter at the next session.
the authority<U+0092>s legal counsel said netherland<U+0092>s point was important and that the matter was mentioned in the summary report of the commission in the context of issues relating to the operation of the enterprise, in paragraph 34. he said the president<U+0092>s report could emphasise the points raised by the netherlands.
the russian federation said there was a translation error on the last line of paragraph 2 of the decision that changed the meaning in russian and asked that it be corrected.
fiji said it supported the 12-paragraph draft decision but needed clarification on the term <U+0093>geographically disadvantaged<U+0094> in reference to developing states in paragraph 6. brazil noted that the term appeared in part xi of the united nations convention on the law of the sea. more precisely, trinidad and tobago said the term appeared in article 148 of the convention <U+0096> participation of developing states in activities of the area. the representative of trinidad and tobago said while his delegation would not want to change the current wording of the decision, he hoped that in future decisions the term <U+0093>small island developing states<U+0094> could be included in language of decisions of the council.
on the matter of future meetings of the council, brazil, supported by the netherlands, felt there should be an option for the regulatory body of the authority to convene more frequent meetings when necessary, particularly to deal with pending new regulations.
before closing the final meeting for the twentieth session, president of the council, tommo monthe (cameroon) hailed the cooperation that prevailed among delegations and allowed the council to complete its 17-point agenda. <U+0093>we need this spirit of cooperation to ensure the success of our work now and in the future<U+0094>, he said.
highlights of the council session
a highlight of the council<U+0092>s session was the adoption of a draft decision (isba/20/c/l.2) by which the assembly would approve us$ 15,743,143 for the authority<U+0092>s operations for the biennium 2015-2016.
the draft decision, based on recommendations of the finance committee, was amended to include two additional paragraphs, one urging members of the committee to fulfil their obligations to attend its meetings. the other would request the secretary-general to provide in future a complete narrative in support of his budget proposals, including a breakdown of projected costs for large items of expenditure, and to ensure that the budget was in line with the priorities set by both the council and the assembly. an existing paragraph was also amended to express appreciation to those members of the authority who have made voluntary contributions to the voluntary trust fund and the international seabed authority endowment fund.
the council, at its second meeting of the session, took note of two reports of the secretary-general. one report addressed the status of prospecting and contract for exploration for three types of mineral resources in the seabed area- polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts (20/c/12 and isba/20/c/12/add.1). it included information on the status of the periodic review of the implementation of the exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules between the international seabed authority and the government of india.
the second report outlined laws, regulations, and administrative measures adopted by sponsoring states and other members of the authority with respect to activity in the area.
the council examined procedures for possible extension of exploration contracts and mechanisms for the formulation of regulations for exploitation in the area during discussions of a summary report of the chair of the legal and technical commission on its february and july sessions.
the council adopted amendments to two separate regulations - prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides and prospecting and exploration for polymetallic nodules.
in other matters, it elected the czech republic to the remaining position for vice-president for the eastern european group, joining argentina (latin american and caribbean states), bangladesh (the asian group) and the netherlands (western european and others group) who were elected at the council<U+0092>s first meeting.
ahead of the debate, the 36-member council received an explanatory note on the <U+0093>environmental management plan in the regulatory framework for mineral exploitation in the area<U+0094> (isba/20/c/13) prepared by the netherlands.tweets by isbahq",2021-04-08

españolannouncement24 august 2020the international seabed authority (isa) is inviting comments from stakeholders on the first set of draft standards and guidelines to support the implementation of the draft regulations for exploitation of mineral resources in the international seabed area (the area).

the draft regulations on exploitation of mineral resources in the area (isba/25/c/wp.1) require that certain issues are addressed in accordance with, or taking into account, standards and guidelines to be developed by the organs of the isa. the standards will be legally binding on contractors and the isa, whereas the guidelines will be recommendatory in nature.

during the 25th session of the isa, the council requested that the legal and technical commission (ltc) undertake work on standards and guidelines as a matter of priority, noting the proposed process and schedule for the development of standards and guidelines contained in isba/25/c/19/add.1, annex and enclosures i and ii. the ltc recommended a three-phase approach, as follows:

phase 1: standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place by the time of adoption of the draft regulations on exploitation.
	phase 2: standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place prior to the receipt of an application of a plan of work for exploitation.
	phase 3: standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place before commercial mining activities commence in the area
the process recommended by the ltc for the development of these standards and guidelines includes the circulation of the drafts for stakeholder consultations. information on the lists of documents currently available for consultation and the instructions for submission can be accessed here: https://bit.ly/3j3glky.

at isa<U+0092>s 26th session, having advanced its consideration of a number of standards and guidelines under phase 1, the ltc developed and decided to put forward the first set of draft standards and guidelines for stakeholder consultations.

members and observers of the authority as well as contractors are hereby invited to submit their comments on the drafts to the secretariat at ola@isa.org.jm using the dedicated review template by 20 october 2020.

español29 november 2011, nadi, fiji -- speaking at the opening of the workshop on environmental management needs for exploration and exploitation of deep seabed minerals, nii allotey odunton, secretary-general of the international seabed authority told participants that isa has taken steps to augment the international community's knowledge base in order to facilitate adequate environmental protection from mining.
he said these steps included standardizing data and data collection methods in order to develop robust databases to facilitate decision-making.
""it is becoming clear that exploitation of marine mineral resources is becoming increasingly likely and with this increase in activity, the potential impacts on the marine environment need to be addressed, particularly that of environmental impact assessments"", he said.
""we are entering a new stage in the development of marine minerals"".
the secretary-general also said the authority will begin work on an exploitation code next year which is expected to include the requirement for environmental impact assessment.
the workshop is being held in nadi, fiji from 29 november - 2 december 2011. its objectives are to increase awareness of the nature of the mineral resources in marine areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (<U+0093>the area<U+0094>), and on the outer continental shelf, and the measures taken by the international seabed authority with regard to the protection of the marine environment from the harmful effects of deep seabed mining and the applicability of such measures to the development of marine minerals within national jurisdiction; and to formulate preliminary recommendations for environmental impact assessments (eia) of seabed mining both within and beyond national jurisdiction.

españolannouncement05 november 2020today the international seabed authority (isa) issued a video statement by the secretary-general, mr michael w. lodge, providing a progress report on the work of isa over the last months. 

noting that although the covid-19 pandemic has forced isa to adjust to new working conditions and constraints, the isa secretary-general stressed the remarkable progress made by the organization in the execution of its work. in so doing, the secretary-general commended the staff of the secretariat for their resilience and ongoing dedication and commitment.

the secretary-general also expressed his sincere appreciation to all the members of the legal and technical commission who gave substantially of their time, often in very difficult circumstances, to complete the agenda of the commission. reference was made to the fact that the first three sets of draft standards and guidelines for deep sea mining operations have been issued for stakeholder consultation.

on the development of the mining code, the isa secretary-general highlighted that important background work has been undertaken pending the moment where the council will be able to meet again physically and resume its work on this matter. this includes major work on the financial and economic model for seabed mining, as well as a study in relation to the proposed environmental compensation fund.

mr lodge also emphasized the ambitious programme of online workshops on the development of regional environmental management plans and related matters, including standardization for taxonomic identification as well as data collection and analysis, launched by isa in the past months. <U+0093>the reaction to these workshops has been overwhelmingly positive, with widespread participation from leading scientists worldwide as well as a broad range of member states,<U+0094> noted the secretary-general. <U+0093>in presenting this ambitious programme, we have not only created a significant body of new scientific work that will help to protect the marine environment, but we have also created a new model for transparent and inclusive scientific collaboration that will be used in future to supplement  traditional approaches,<U+0094> added mr lodge.

the secretary-general also highlighted important progress in the development of a draft communications and stakeholder engagement strategy which will soon be released for public consultations. he also indicated that isa has joined forces to achieve shared objectives in important international initiatives such as the current work led by the united nations global compact and the launch of its ocean stewardship 2030 report and; the adoption of the roadmap for accelerated implementation of the vienna programme of action for landlocked developing countries, led by the office of the high representative for the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states (un-ohrlls).

significant development has also been made in the perspective of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development, starting in 2021. a draft action plan has been developed and will be presented for adoption by the isa assembly before the end of 2020. the isa secretary-general further underscored that he was <U+0093>particularly pleased that argentina has announced its willingness to act as a champion for the authority<U+0092>s own action plan for marine scientific research in support of the un decade.<U+0094> 

in its progress report, mr. michael w. lodge urged for the election of the incoming members of the council so that they can fulfil their tasks for 2021. <U+0093>this is a matter that has always been dealt with by consensus, as required by the convention and the 1994 agreement, and there should be no reason why this cannot be done in 2020,<U+0094> he added.

finally, mr. michael w. lodge underlined the importance for isa to adopt a budget, based on the recommendation of the finance committee which also completed its work. <U+0093>without a budget, the authority will be unable to function and all activities will cease. i look forward to the budget progressing smoothly through the council and the assembly and urge all members to take a pragmatic and flexible approach in the interests of the authority,<U+0094> he said.

the exploration contract was signed on friday, 12 may in beijing, china by the secretary-general of the international seabed authority, michael lodge and the chairman of china minmetals corporation, he wenbo. 
the allocated area covers a surface area of 72,745 km2 of the clarion-clipperton fracture zone in the pacific ocean.
at the signing ceremony, secretary-general lodge said  ""china, and indeed the whole world, is facing a tremendous challenge <U+0096> how can we meet an increasing metal demand in an environmentally sustainable way? in two weeks<U+0092> time, we shall be meeting at the united nations in new york to discuss the challenges for the implementation of sustainable development goal 14; the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources"". 
""if we are serious about developing a blue economy, based on sustainable use of marine resources, and a low carbon future, we are going to need an increased supply of metals for the world economy. renewable technologies for example require two to three times more steel per megawatt generated that conventional infrastructure. increased supplies of strategic metals such as cobalt and tellurium will also be needed "". 
""we also need to acquire these minerals without increasing our overall carbon footprint"".
china  is also sponsoring another contractor with the authority for the exploration for polymetallic nodules in the clarion clipperton zone since 2001, and for which a five-year extension was signed recently between secretary-general lodge and comra secretary-general liu feng.

he added that the convention takes a holistic approach to the protection of the marine environment.
<U+0093>this essential reality is recognized by the convention itself, which in its third preambular paragraph reminds us that <U+0091>the problems of ocean space are interrelated and need to be considered as a whole.<U+0094> 
<U+0093>to address these problems, the fundamental frame of reference within the convention is the marine environment as a whole. it is worth noting that the convention places no boundaries on the protection it gives to the marine environment. thus, it brings within its purview the adverse effects on the marine environment from activities on land and in the atmosphere.<U+0094>
mr ascencio-herrera pointed out that while the ocean space is subject to the environmental protection obligations in part xii, the convention deals with the implementation and enforcement of those obligations based on the strict jurisdictional boundaries established in other parts of the convention. these boundaries may be geographic, as in the different maritime zones, or established by reference to the functional competence to regulate certain activities.
 in this regard, he highlighted that it is essential therefore, that the conference does not overlook or undermine the existing provisions of the convention, and that it fully respect the rights and jurisdictions carefully elaborated in the convention.

in his opening address president of the assembly, antonio francisco da costa e silva neto (brazil), pointed to the historic importance of the special session describing it as <U+0093>a momentous occasion<U+0094> for the authority and the world, a theme that resounded in speeches throughout the day-long celebration. in welcoming the prime minister of jamaica to the event the president underscored the host country<U+0092>s contribution to the work of the authority.
describing the authority as <U+0093>a radical establishment that is vital today as it was 20 years ago<U+0094>, the prime minister of host country jamaica, the most honourable portia simpson miller, said there were some critical issues that the authority must continue to address. among them were the management and governance of mineral resources of the deep seabed, the sharing of those resources, sustainability of fisheries, and the development of new mining techniques to protect the marine environment.
the authority<U+0092>s secretary-general, nii allotey odunton (ghana), said there was urgent need for rationalization of data related to marine mineral resources. the authority also needed more baseline environmental data, including the use of standardize taxonomies, for lesser known deposits, fauna, and species of which very little was known. it would be important at the mining stage to have reference to data, nomenclature, and taxonomy references for the deposits.
tommy koh, ambassador-at-large, singapore ministry of foreign affairs, in a keynote speech, said the visibility of the authority must be raised to inform the world about its important mission. the authority should enhance its outreach programme, and also encourage the leading law schools of the world to teach a module on part xi of the convention covering seabed mining provisions.
satya n. nandan, the authority<U+0092>s first secretary-general (1996-2008), said the next stage of the authority<U+0092>s work must relate to the priority item of developing a regulatory regime for exploitation of deep seabed minerals. that should be done in a timely manner. the credibility of the authority depended very much on the confidence it generated among its members as well as among those willing to work with it in the development of the common heritage resources.
statements were also made by judge josé luis jesus, member of the international tribunal for the law of the sea, and former chairman of the preparatory commission for the international seabed authority (1987-1994); hasjim djalal, first president of the assembly of the authority (1996); judge vladimir golitsyn, president of the disputes chamber (on behalf of the president of the tribunal); and chairpersons of the five regional groups. some individual delegations and observers spoke.
this year also marks the twentieth anniversary of the entry into force of the united nations convention on the law of the sea on 16 november 1994. guyana deposited the sixtieth instrument of ratification to make that possible. the convention was opened for signature on 10 december 19892 at montego bay, jamaica. today<U+0092>s commemoration was brought forward to coincide with the twentieth annual session of the authority.
the 166-member authority is responsible for all mineral-related activities in the deep seabed area beyond national jurisdiction. its main tasks include administering the mineral resources of the area, the promotion and encouragement of marine scientific research in the deep seabed area, and ensuring the effective protection of the marine environment. 
   statements
the authority<U+0092>s secretary-general nii allotey odunton (ghana) said there was urgent need for rationalization of data related to marine mineral resources. the authority needed more baseline environmental data, including the use of standardize taxonomies, for lesser known deposits, fauna, and species of which very little was known. mr. odunton said it would be important at the mining stage to have reference to data, nomenclature, and taxonomy references for the deposits.
noting that the authority also needed to focus on the standardization of technologies for the extraction of nodules, the secretary-general reminded the assembly of the importance of the legal and technical commission, the expert body entrusted with assessing the environmental impact of activities in the deep seabed area and advising the authority on all matters relating to exploration and exploitation of non-living marine resources. 
mr. odunton said he never imagined that the authority would have signed 26 contracts for exploration within the first twenty years of its existence. expressing his appreciation to the government and people of the host country for their hospitality and assistance, he said he looked forward to the authority being in jamaica when actual mining began.
the most honourable portia simpson miller, prime minister of jamaica, describing the authority as <U+0093>a radical establishment that is vital today as it was 20 years ago<U+0094>, said there were some critical issues that the organization must continue to address.  among them were the management and governance of mineral resources of the deep seabed, the sharing of those resources, sustainability of fisheries, and the development of new mining techniques to protect the marine environment.
the prime minister commended the secretary-general, his staff, and member states of the authority for the strong focus on environmental protection and conservation of the living non-renewable resources in the area. she said that a healthy international seabed authority <U+0093>is necessary and especially important for island states such as ours in the caribbean which depend on the quality of the natural environment and derive much of their economic growth from the use of natural resources<U+0094>. 
mrs. simpson miller described the work of the authority over the next few years as critical to the support of the region and small island states<U+0092> development objectives.  she called on the authority to remain a strong and unified voice in the wider universe through the promotion of diplomacy at sea, investment in training, and capacity building to open doors to development opportunities.
ban ki-moon, secretary-general of the united nations, in a message, said the concept of the <U+0093>common heritage of mankind<U+0094> represented by the seabed, ocean floor and subsoil, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (the area) was a major innovation in international law. it replaced uncertainties concerning the future of the seabed with a regime of shared benefits and responsibilities for all states, including land-locked ones.
he said the ongoing development by the authority of a comprehensive set of rules governing seabed mining would go a long way towards helping states to derive tangible benefits from the area. he urged member states to recommit themselves to implementing the united nations convention on the law of the sea and in participating in the authority<U+0092>s work. the u.n. secretary-general<U+0092>s message was delivered by stephen mathias, assistant secretary-general for legal affairs.
 
tommy koh, ambassador-at-large, singapore ministry of foreign affairs, in a keynote speech, said the visibility of the authority must be raised to inform the world about its important mission. the authority should enhance its outreach programme, and also encourage the leading law schools of the world to teach a module on part xi of the convention covering seabed mining provisions.
mr. koh said that when financial resources become available, the authority should proceed to build the international seabed authority museum to showcase the results of research on and new discoveries of the flora, fauna and mineral resources of the last frontier, which covered an area of 160 million square kilometres.  looking to the future, he said the authority must begin to formulate the rules, regulations and procedures applicable to exploitation contracts. the authority must encourage those engaged in exploration to proceed to the next stage of exploitation.     
      
satya n. nandan, the authority<U+0092>s first secretary-general (1996-2008), said the next stage of the authority<U+0092>s work must relate to the priority item of developing a regulatory regime for exploitation of deep seabed minerals. that should be done in a timely manner. the credibility of the authority depended very much on the confidence it generated among its members as well as among those willing to work with it in the development of the common heritage resources.
the authority<U+0092>s regulations must be fair to the contractor as well as to the authority which represented the interests of mankind as a whole. mankind would only benefit if mining in fact took place. it was not the function of the authority to simply distribute sites to all applicants without a good faith effort by them to develop the resources, because that did not serve the interests of mankind.
he said the authority<U+0092>s assembly, council and legal and technical commission should continue to be objective and fair in their decision-making and where appropriate, use the best available scientific information. 
judge josé luis jesus, member of the international tribunal for the law of the sea, and chairman of the preparatory commission for the international seabed authority, (1987-1994) said that by putting in place the necessary instruments and steadily developing the regulatory framework on which the seabed activities might take place, the authority had brought member states closer to the exploitation phase. that was a major achievement of its work over the last twenty years. to be able to carry on and bring its work to a point where the possibilities of commercial exploitation of seabed resources could be seen was a good cause to celebrate the authority<U+0092>s twenty years.
he said the authority<U+0092>s success was necessarily the success of the convention whose strength could be measured through the operation of the institutional framework it established. the three institutions the convention created <U+0096> the international seabed authority, the international tribunal and the commission on the limits of the continental shelf - were operating fully. their activities were very important and in some cases indispensable to states, he added.
prof. hasjim djalal, first president of the international seabed authority (1996), traced the history of the search for seabed mineral resources from as early as 1918 when oil resources were exploited by american interests in the gulf of mexico. he referred to the truman declaration of 1945, through which the united states claimed the right to control the resources of its continental shelf. 
that was a milestone in the development of the law of the sea, prof. djalal said, as other states began to follow suit, although there was as yet no legal definition of the meaning of the term <U+0093>continental shelf<U+0094>. a legal definition was adopted by the geneva convention in 1958, but it was ambassador arvid pardo of malta at the united nations general assembly in 1967 who first raised the question of who owned the mineral resources of the deep seabed and what rules should govern their exploitation.
in 1970, the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution that designated the resources as <U+0093>the common heritage of mankind<U+0094> and called for the establishment of an international authority as the steward of that heritage, leading to the adoption of the united nations convention on the law of the sea in 1982. he hoped that someday the united states and other non-ratifiers would see the benefits of ratifying the convention <U+0093>rather than staying away out if it<U+0092>.
judge vladimir golitsyn, president of the seabed disputes chamber of the international tribunal for the law of the sea, bringing greetings on behalf of the president of the tribunal, judge shunji yanai, spoke of the relationship of <U+0093>fruitful cooperation<U+0094> between the authority and the chamber.
outlining the mandate of his organization, judge golitsyn explained that the tribunal had jurisdiction over contentious cases, both between states parties concerning the interpretation or application of the convention<U+0092>s regime for the deep seabed, and between a state party and the authority.  with regard to the advisory jurisdiction of the tribunal, the rationale was that in carrying out its functions in accordance with the convention, the authority might <U+0093>require assistance of an independent and impartial judicial body.
the judge announced that a joint regional workshop was being planned to take place in ghana later this year to disseminate information on the work of both the authority and the tribunal to government officials from the region of west africa. 
regional groups<U+0092> statements
nigeria said the african group welcomed efforts and initiatives that would facilitate the development of the mining code for contractors ready and willing to move to the next stage of exploitation.  the group called on contractors to carry out their obligations with utmost dedication and make available all necessary information and data to assist the work of the authority. nigeria said the group recognized the quality leadership provided by secretary-general nii allotey odunton who, he described as <U+0093>a distinguished african and pride of the continent<U+0094>.
speaking on behalf of the asian and pacific states, fiji paid homage to ambassador arvid pardo of malta and other forefathers of the authority. the representative spoke of the responsibility of the authority to manage the natural resources of the area while preserving the marine environment.
russian federation foreign minister sergey lavrov, in a message to the authority<U+0092>s secretary-general on the occasion, said the authority had gained <U+0093>a firm hold as a reputable international organization<U+0094> that effectively ensured the implementation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea with the purpose of managing the deep seabed area and its resources that formed the common heritage of mankind.
the russian federation, as one of the main contractors, highly valued the work done by the authority in organizing and controlling activities in the area. russia attached special importance to the efforts to elaborate and improve the legal basis of cooperation for the development of the area<U+0092>s resources and rules for searching and prospecting. it was important that account was taken of the interests and needs of developing and least developed states, as well as applicable standards in the sphere of ecological safety and protection of the marine environment. he assured the secretary-general of russia<U+0092>s <U+0093>firm intention<U+0094> to be actively involved in the work of the authority.    the message was read by the representative of russian federation who is chair of the eastern european group.
speaking on behalf of the latin american and caribbean group, mexico said that the best way to honour the work of those who were instrumental in establishing the authority would be to reaffirm the commitment of its members to undertake the new challenges ahead. the representative added that mechanisms were needed to evaluate and manage the environmental impact of mining operations as well as financial rules related to the benefits of exploitation. he noted the importance of taking into account the needs of developing countries.
mexico also noted with satisfaction at the increase in the number of permanent representatives to the authority, most of which were members of the group.
speaking on behalf of the western european and others group, the representative of germany noted that the convention was the radiant result of the great effort undertaken by the international community to conceive a universal legal framework for the oceans. he stated that this <U+0093>constitution of the oceans, in the face of the challenges inherent in its activities, had proven both efficient and flexible.
furthermore, he pointed to the commitment of members of the western european and others group to the authority, reflected in the fact that seven of the exploration contracts approved had been sponsored by member states of this group, adding that they had also implemented cooperation projects with international partners and particularly developing states.
he added that this period marking the end of the first exploration contracts and the progress towards the exploitation phase brought new challenges that western european and others group was ready to take on along with the authority
afternoon meeting
on the resumption of the session following the lunch break, delegates were treated to a musical presentation by a youth group collegium musicum jamaica.  mr. mumba kapumpa, ambassador of zambia to south korea, was the first speaker after the break. he traced the birth and early development of the authority noting the spirit of compromise and the corporation that permeated. he said land-locked states compromised on almost every issue. <U+0093>everything we did was by way of compromise<U+0094>, he told the assembly. mr. kapumpa said the united nations convention on the law of the sea was intended to provide <U+0093>a calmness of the oceans<U+0094> following conflict in deliberations between states over issues of the deep seabed. celebrating the authority<U+0092>s achievements twenty years later, he confirmed the seas <U+0093>are calmer.<U+0094>
describing the special session as a ceremonial handing over by the pioneers to those who have come after 1994, mr. kapumpa praised the secretary-general for his ability to calm situations and for always being available to assist delegations to arrive at consensus.
baïdy diène who served as president of the authority (2014) was a member of the legal and technical commission (2002-2011) said he was privileged to witness the conception, birth and evolution of the authority. he recognized the work of those who pioneered the creation of the authority saying they faced many problems but had found solutions through consensus to advance the work of the organisation. mr. diène also praised the <U+0093>enlightened leadership<U+0094> of the two secretary-generals, (satya n. nandan (1996-2008) and nii allotey odunton, the current secretary-general). like other delegations he emphasised the importance of training to benefit developing states especially and hoped that, with twenty-six contractors training would flourish.
speaking on behalf of the pacific small island developing states (psids), tonga described the close relationship between the oceans and the lives and livelihoods of the peoples of the pacific islands. he suggested that this was one of the reasons that all psids were parties of the convention and had committed themselves to its principles. the representative said that the state of the marine environment was deteriorating rapidly, so the twentieth anniversary of authority was a good opportunity to recommit to the preservation and equitable utilization of marine resources.
the representative of mexico spoke of the important role played by the oceans in human life, saying that states had an undeniable responsibility to protect them for future generations.  he commended the authority for its efforts to forge a strong relationship between developed and developing nations with regard to marine scientific research and resource exploration in the area.
trinidad and tobago said that in elaborating regulations for the exploitation of deep seabed minerals, member states must insist on the formulation of <U+0093>robust provisions to safeguard the marine environment.<U+0094> it added that the authority must make progress in developing environmental management plans to govern activities in the area, particularly for those zones for which exploration contracts were in force.
the authority also had a role to play, the trinidad and tobago representative noted, in shaping the implementation agreement being considered under the aegis of the un general assembly, relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. he added that as a matter of priority, the legal and technical commission should be mandated to begin working on policies to give effect to article 82 of the convention, which he characterized as dormant. (article 82 requires states parties to make payment or contributions in respect of the resource of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles).
indonesia noted that it had been involved with the authority since ambassador hasjim djalal was appointed as the first president of the assembly. the representative said his country would continue to support the work of the authority which, he said, was making good progress in the right direction.
south africa said that the principle of the common heritage of mankind was about <U+0093>solidarity in the preservation and conservation of a good<U+0094> to be shared by all for the benefit of all. it added that in moving toward the exploitation phase it was important to establish a fiscal framework for mining that was fair to industry, investors, member states and all mankind.
bangladesh, speaking for the first time in the assembly, pointed out that it was among the 119 member states who became signatories to the convention on the first day it was opened for signature.  the representative took the opportunity to inform the assembly that the dispute concerning delimitation of the maritime boundary between bangladesh, india and myanmar in the bay of bengal had been settled by the international tribunal for the law of the sea (itlos).
 
he said the ruling represented a victory for all three countries by peacefully resolving an issue that had hampered their economic development for over three decades.
the representative of fiji noted that when his country ratified the convention in 1982, it was seen as a just and equitable governance system for the world<U+0092>s oceans. there had been no cause for disappointment, he said, adding that the convention had become embedded in the affairs of nations and continued to serve as a guide in other areas of law.
the representative of cuba said her delegation saw the authority as an essential instrument for maintaining and strengthening peace, order and sustainable development in oceans and seas. cuba had in the last twenty years made huge efforts to implement national strategies for sustainable development and the protection of the marine environment. cuba reiterated the importance of strengthening international cooperation in the management of marine resources and the care of the oceans and their biodiversity, duly respecting the jurisdiction of states over their territorial sea and the management of resources in their exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.  
india referred to the convention as an instrument containing several revolutionary elements. it confirmed its commitment to facilitating training for participants from developing countries, and spoke of a workshop to be held in india later this year to assist contractors to prepare estimates of mineable sites within exploration areas.
the philippines described the convention as playing a key role in ensuring global peace and cooperation. panama renewed its commitment to the authority, which it described as the product of one of the most important and far-reaching instruments in international law, namely the convention. st kitts and nevis commended the authority for its commitment to preserve the world<U+0092>s rich marine heritage. in the final intervention from a member state, jamaica committed to continue to fulfil its obligations as host country in spite of limited resources.
the representative of senegal said that his country and six others were working on a joint submission to be made to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf (clcs) for an extension of the continental shelf. he expressed appreciation to the government of norway for its assistance in beginning the submission process, adding that the deposit of the joint request would be an example of regional as well as north-south cooperation.
guyana informed the assembly that on 6 september 2011, her country had made a submission for an extended continental shelf in accordance with article 76, paragraph 8, of the convention. the country was still awaiting a ruling on the matter.
brazil stated that it had sponsored an application for approval of a plan of work for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, which showed its commitment to the growth and consolidation of the authority.
four observers also spoke at the session. they are greenpeace international, world wildlife fund international, international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources, and deep sea conservation coalition.  the organisations highlighted the impact of climate change on the oceans and the importance of transparency in the authority<U+0092>s operations.
the assembly meets today, 23 july, to consider the annual report of the secretary-general of the authority. before that meeting the authority<U+0092>s council will convene briefly to adopt a draft decision relating to the summary report of the chair of the legal and technical commission.

españoljamaica, kingston (14 july 2016) <U+0096> the isa legal and technical commission today issued the initial working draft regulations and standard contract terms on exploitation for mineral resources in the area as part of its remit from the council to develop the mining code for activities in the area.
the draft is a first step toward consolidating the views of the authority<U+0092>s stakeholder base following a number of stakeholder consultation initiatives in 2015, workshops and technical discussion papers issued by the authority.
the working draft represents the first phase in the development of a full suite of regulations that will include inter alia rules, regulations and procedures relating to environmental assessment and management, the setting up of a mining directorate and inspectorate and the equitable sharing of the receipts from mining activities.
the commission considers the draft as work in progress and that it does not represent the final views of the commission. at this stage the commission is seeking the views and opinions on the content and structure (as opposed to any fine-tuning of the drafting language) of the working draft from the authority<U+0092>s stakeholder base. 
these views will be presented to the newly elected commission in february 2017 together with a revised working draft. it is intended that the next commission will formulate a clear methodology with regard to the elaboration of the mining code, timelines and stakeholder contribution in the regulatory content and drafting process in connection with regulatory development. additionally, subsequent development of the mining code will also reflect any recommendations adopted by the authority flowing from the current article 154 review.
in the meantime, the current commission will recommend to the council, for their consideration at the 22nd session of the authority, a number of action areas to advance the further development of the mining code.
members of the authority and all stakeholders are invited to comment on the working draft.
the closing date of responses to the working draft is wednesday, 2nd november 2016 at 1800hr (est). submissions can be sent via email (in either word or pdf format) to consultation@isa.org.jm or by post to:

españoljamaica, kingston (4 july 2016) - - extensions of the first set of exploration contracts, new applications for approval of plans of work for exploration and the development of draft regulations for exploitation of polymetallic nodules in the deep seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (the area) are among priority issues to be debated as the twenty-second annual session of the international seabed authority convenes in kingston, jamaica, from 11 to 22 july 2016. 
other matters before the session include an interim report on the way the legal regime for the area had operated in accordance with article 154 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, and elections to the finance committee, legal and technical commission and council of the authority.
on the extension of contracts, six contracts issued by the authority in 2001 for the exploration for polymetallic nodules in the area will expire in 2016. the contractors have each applied for a five-year extension which were examined by the authority<U+0092>s expert body, the legal and technical commission at its first session of 2016 (22 february to 4 march). the commission<U+0092>s recommendations are expected to be considered by the authority<U+0092>s executive council at its july session.
another priority item on the commission<U+0092>s agenda was the development of the draft minerals exploitation regulations for which a time frame of 12 to 18 months for its completion was agreed upon in 2015. an initial draft text was scheduled to be circulated to all stakeholders in march 2016 for their comments and observations before its submission to the council in july 2016. 
the authority has since 2000 formulated and adopted regulations  for exploration  for polymetallic nodules in the area (adopted on 13 july 2000, and later updated and adopted 25 july 2013); polymetallic sulphides in the area (adopted 7 may 2010 and amended in 2013 and 2014); and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the area (adopted 27 july 2012 and amended in 2013). pursuant to these regulations, the legal and technical commission of the authority has issued recommendations for the guidance of contractors covering, among others, content, format and structure of their annual reports; exploration expenditure reporting; and assessment of environmental impacts resulting from their operations in the area. there is also a guide for contractors and sponsoring states on training programmes under plans of work for exploration. 
elections will be held during the session for a secretary-general of the authority for the period 2017-2020; half of the 36-member council; the 25-member legal and technical commission and also for the 15-member finance committee, whose terms of office, like those on the commission, expire on 31 december 2016.
the secretary-general would be elected from among a list to be proposed by the council. the candidates, so far, are the current secretary-general, nii allotey odunton (ghana), and the legal counsel and deputy to the secretary-general, michael lodge (united kingdom).   
  
officers of the twenty-second session to be elected will be a nominee of the asia and pacific group, for the presidency of the assembly; and a nominee of the eastern european states group for the presidency of the council. each of the other regional groups will nominate vice-presidents of the assembly and the council. a credentials committee will also be appointed.
established in 1994 with the entry into force that year by the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea, the authority administers the mineral resources of the deep seabed beyond areas of national jurisdiction (described by the convention as the area), and the sharing of the economic benefits with all states, including the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged. it is also required under the convention and the 1994 agreement relating to the implementation of part xi of the convention to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful activities.
finance committee.     
at its meetings before the opening of the session, the authority<U+0092>s finance committee will consider the secretary-general<U+0092>s proposed budget for the organization for the financial period 2017-2018, and review the implementation of the 2015-2016 budget and audited financial statements. it will also consider potential cost-saving measures taken by the authority since the last session. 
     
the committee will review the status of the authority<U+0092>s working capital fund, the status of the international seabed authority endowment fund for marine scientific research in the area, the voluntary trust fund as well as the status of the implementation of the international public sector accounting standards. 
the finance committee members will take note of a report of the secretary-general (isba/22/fc/2) prepared in response to its request at the last session, on the possibility, from a legal perspective, of considering advances from the endowment fund to the voluntary trust fund to be grants.
the voluntary trust fund was established in 2002 to help members of the authority from developing countries participate fully in the meetings of the legal and technical commission and the finance committee. it is funded by members of the authority and others.
the endowment fund, established in 2006, promotes and encourages the conduct of marine scientific research in the area for the benefit of mankind as a whole. it carries this out by supporting the participation of qualified scientists and technical personnel from developing countries and also by providing them with opportunities to be involved in relevant initiatives.
according to the authority<U+0092>s secretariat, as at 1 december 2015, a total of 76 scientists and government officials from 40 developing countries have obtained financial support from the endowment fund.  
an annex to the secretary-general<U+0092>s report to the finance committee shows the total amounts transferred from the endowment fund to the voluntary trust fund to date. 
legal and technical commission
at its february 2016 meetings, the legal and technical commission focused on priority items on its agenda, including the applications for five-year extensions of the six contracts for exploration for polymetallic nodules in the area and the development of the minerals exploitation regulations.
the six contractors are: yuzhmorgeologiya sponsored by the russian federation, the interoceanmetal joint organization sponsored by bulgaria, cuba, czech republic, poland, the russian federation and slovakia, the government of the republic of korea, the china ocean mineral resources research and development association sponsored by china, deep ocean resources development co. ltd sponsored by japan, and the institut français de recherche pour l<U+0092>exploitation de la mer.

the commission meetings which began today (4 to 11 july) will act on any new applications for approval of plans of work for exploration; review reports of exploration contractors as well as its own recommendations on possible environmental impacts arising from exploitation of marine minerals.
it will review reports on the outcomes and recommendations of workshops on the standardization of the taxonomy of the mega, macro and meiofauna associated with polymetallic nodules. the standardization is said to be relevant to the baseline biological data being gathered by contractors for polymetallic nodules, the environmental management plan for the clarion-clipperton fracture zone (ccz) in the pacific, the proposed impact and preservation zones and environmental impact assessment. 
 other matters referred to the commission last year by the council, but which were not acted upon due to time constraints, will be taken up at its july meetings. these include issues relating to the operation of the projected mining arm of the authority, the enterprise, and sponsorship by states of contracts for exploration in the area.

other topics on the council<U+0092>s agenda are the status of national legislation concerning deep seabed mining and related matters; legal questions concerning potential conflicts between the right of all states to carry out marine scientific research in the area and the authority<U+0092>s obligations under exploration contracts. it will also make recommendations to the assembly on the finance committee<U+0092>s proposals on the authority<U+0092>s budget for the financial period 2017-2018 and the scale of assessment for contributions to it.

at the last session, a note of the secretary-general to the council on the elections ( isba/21/c/6) stressed the importance of the qualifications of the candidates, particularly the securing of appropriate combination of relevant expertise that would determine the effective discharge of the commission<U+0092>s functions as it intensified its efforts to formulate a regulatory regime for minerals exploitation.  equally important, according to the note, was the issue of the independence of commission members and the avoidance of any actual or perceived conflict of interest. 
the first election of commission members was held in august 1996.  after failing to agree on the balance of regional representation on the commission, the council took advantage of a provision in the convention (article 163, paragraph 2) to increase the size of the commission from 15 to 22, without prejudice to future elections. the same procedure was repeated for the elections in 2001, 2006 and 2011. on each occasion, the council approved all the candidates submitted, increasing the number of seats on the commission from 15 to 24 in 2001 and to 25 in 2006 and 2011, without prejudice to future elections and the claims of the regional groups and interest groups.
