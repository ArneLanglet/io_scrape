training and capacity-building have been an integral feature of isa’s activities since its establishment in 1994. this responsibility is also recognized in the strategic plan and high-level action plan for the period 2019–2023 under strategic direction 5 (build capacity for developing states) and 6 (ensure integrated participation by developing states).

following the decision of the assembly, the secretariat will design a strategy in 2021 that builds on national ownership and leadership, fosters strategic partnerships, and leverages the accumulated knowledge, while ensuring that the required resources – financial and human – are in place to enable member states to make the best possible use of the opportunities available to them.

at the start of the meeting, the assembly elected russian federation as a vice-president, nominated by the eastern european group, to complete the slate of vice presidents that includes china, for the asian group and france and nigeria representing the western european and others and the african groups, respectively.
in his opening address president of the assembly, antonio francisco da costa e silva neto (brazil), pointed to the historic importance of the special session describing it as “a momentous occasion” for the authority and the world, a theme that resounded in speeches throughout the day-long celebration. in welcoming the prime minister of jamaica to the event the president underscored the host country’s contribution to the work of the authority.
describing the authority as “a radical establishment that is vital today as it was 20 years ago”, the prime minister of host country jamaica, the most honourable portia simpson miller, said there were some critical issues that the authority must continue to address. among them were the management and governance of mineral resources of the deep seabed, the sharing of those resources, sustainability of fisheries, and the development of new mining techniques to protect the marine environment.
the authority’s secretary-general, nii allotey odunton (ghana), said there was urgent need for rationalization of data related to marine mineral resources. the authority also needed more baseline environmental data, including the use of standardize taxonomies, for lesser known deposits, fauna, and species of which very little was known. it would be important at the mining stage to have reference to data, nomenclature, and taxonomy references for the deposits.
tommy koh, ambassador-at-large, singapore ministry of foreign affairs, in a keynote speech, said the visibility of the authority must be raised to inform the world about its important mission. the authority should enhance its outreach programme, and also encourage the leading law schools of the world to teach a module on part xi of the convention covering seabed mining provisions.
satya n. nandan, the authority’s first secretary-general (1996-2008), said the next stage of the authority’s work must relate to the priority item of developing a regulatory regime for exploitation of deep seabed minerals. that should be done in a timely manner. the credibility of the authority depended very much on the confidence it generated among its members as well as among those willing to work with it in the development of the common heritage resources.
statements were also made by judge josé luis jesus, member of the international tribunal for the law of the sea, and former chairman of the preparatory commission for the international seabed authority (1987-1994); hasjim djalal, first president of the assembly of the authority (1996); judge vladimir golitsyn, president of the disputes chamber (on behalf of the president of the tribunal); and chairpersons of the five regional groups. some individual delegations and observers spoke.
this year also marks the twentieth anniversary of the entry into force of the united nations convention on the law of the sea on 16 november 1994. guyana deposited the sixtieth instrument of ratification to make that possible. the convention was opened for signature on 10 december 19892 at montego bay, jamaica. today’s commemoration was brought forward to coincide with the twentieth annual session of the authority.
the 166-member authority is responsible for all mineral-related activities in the deep seabed area beyond national jurisdiction. its main tasks include administering the mineral resources of the area, the promotion and encouragement of marine scientific research in the deep seabed area, and ensuring the effective protection of the marine environment. 
   statements
the authority’s secretary-general nii allotey odunton (ghana) said there was urgent need for rationalization of data related to marine mineral resources. the authority needed more baseline environmental data, including the use of standardize taxonomies, for lesser known deposits, fauna, and species of which very little was known. mr. odunton said it would be important at the mining stage to have reference to data, nomenclature, and taxonomy references for the deposits.
noting that the authority also needed to focus on the standardization of technologies for the extraction of nodules, the secretary-general reminded the assembly of the importance of the legal and technical commission, the expert body entrusted with assessing the environmental impact of activities in the deep seabed area and advising the authority on all matters relating to exploration and exploitation of non-living marine resources. 
mr. odunton said he never imagined that the authority would have signed 26 contracts for exploration within the first twenty years of its existence. expressing his appreciation to the government and people of the host country for their hospitality and assistance, he said he looked forward to the authority being in jamaica when actual mining began.
the most honourable portia simpson miller, prime minister of jamaica, describing the authority as “a radical establishment that is vital today as it was 20 years ago”, said there were some critical issues that the organization must continue to address.  among them were the management and governance of mineral resources of the deep seabed, the sharing of those resources, sustainability of fisheries, and the development of new mining techniques to protect the marine environment.
the prime minister commended the secretary-general, his staff, and member states of the authority for the strong focus on environmental protection and conservation of the living non-renewable resources in the area. she said that a healthy international seabed authority “is necessary and especially important for island states such as ours in the caribbean which depend on the quality of the natural environment and derive much of their economic growth from the use of natural resources”. 
mrs. simpson miller described the work of the authority over the next few years as critical to the support of the region and small island states’ development objectives.  she called on the authority to remain a strong and unified voice in the wider universe through the promotion of diplomacy at sea, investment in training, and capacity building to open doors to development opportunities.
ban ki-moon, secretary-general of the united nations, in a message, said the concept of the “common heritage of mankind” represented by the seabed, ocean floor and subsoil, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (the area) was a major innovation in international law. it replaced uncertainties concerning the future of the seabed with a regime of shared benefits and responsibilities for all states, including land-locked ones.
he said the ongoing development by the authority of a comprehensive set of rules governing seabed mining would go a long way towards helping states to derive tangible benefits from the area. he urged member states to recommit themselves to implementing the united nations convention on the law of the sea and in participating in the authority’s work. the u.n. secretary-general’s message was delivered by stephen mathias, assistant secretary-general for legal affairs.
 
tommy koh, ambassador-at-large, singapore ministry of foreign affairs, in a keynote speech, said the visibility of the authority must be raised to inform the world about its important mission. the authority should enhance its outreach programme, and also encourage the leading law schools of the world to teach a module on part xi of the convention covering seabed mining provisions.
mr. koh said that when financial resources become available, the authority should proceed to build the international seabed authority museum to showcase the results of research on and new discoveries of the flora, fauna and mineral resources of the last frontier, which covered an area of 160 million square kilometres.  looking to the future, he said the authority must begin to formulate the rules, regulations and procedures applicable to exploitation contracts. the authority must encourage those engaged in exploration to proceed to the next stage of exploitation.     
      
satya n. nandan, the authority’s first secretary-general (1996-2008), said the next stage of the authority’s work must relate to the priority item of developing a regulatory regime for exploitation of deep seabed minerals. that should be done in a timely manner. the credibility of the authority depended very much on the confidence it generated among its members as well as among those willing to work with it in the development of the common heritage resources.
the authority’s regulations must be fair to the contractor as well as to the authority which represented the interests of mankind as a whole. mankind would only benefit if mining in fact took place. it was not the function of the authority to simply distribute sites to all applicants without a good faith effort by them to develop the resources, because that did not serve the interests of mankind.
he said the authority’s assembly, council and legal and technical commission should continue to be objective and fair in their decision-making and where appropriate, use the best available scientific information. 
judge josé luis jesus, member of the international tribunal for the law of the sea, and chairman of the preparatory commission for the international seabed authority, (1987-1994) said that by putting in place the necessary instruments and steadily developing the regulatory framework on which the seabed activities might take place, the authority had brought member states closer to the exploitation phase. that was a major achievement of its work over the last twenty years. to be able to carry on and bring its work to a point where the possibilities of commercial exploitation of seabed resources could be seen was a good cause to celebrate the authority’s twenty years.
he said the authority’s success was necessarily the success of the convention whose strength could be measured through the operation of the institutional framework it established. the three institutions the convention created – the international seabed authority, the international tribunal and the commission on the limits of the continental shelf - were operating fully. their activities were very important and in some cases indispensable to states, he added.
prof. hasjim djalal, first president of the international seabed authority (1996), traced the history of the search for seabed mineral resources from as early as 1918 when oil resources were exploited by american interests in the gulf of mexico. he referred to the truman declaration of 1945, through which the united states claimed the right to control the resources of its continental shelf. 
that was a milestone in the development of the law of the sea, prof. djalal said, as other states began to follow suit, although there was as yet no legal definition of the meaning of the term “continental shelf”. a legal definition was adopted by the geneva convention in 1958, but it was ambassador arvid pardo of malta at the united nations general assembly in 1967 who first raised the question of who owned the mineral resources of the deep seabed and what rules should govern their exploitation.
in 1970, the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution that designated the resources as “the common heritage of mankind” and called for the establishment of an international authority as the steward of that heritage, leading to the adoption of the united nations convention on the law of the sea in 1982. he hoped that someday the united states and other non-ratifiers would see the benefits of ratifying the convention “rather than staying away out if it’.
judge vladimir golitsyn, president of the seabed disputes chamber of the international tribunal for the law of the sea, bringing greetings on behalf of the president of the tribunal, judge shunji yanai, spoke of the relationship of “fruitful cooperation” between the authority and the chamber.
outlining the mandate of his organization, judge golitsyn explained that the tribunal had jurisdiction over contentious cases, both between states parties concerning the interpretation or application of the convention’s regime for the deep seabed, and between a state party and the authority.  with regard to the advisory jurisdiction of the tribunal, the rationale was that in carrying out its functions in accordance with the convention, the authority might “require assistance of an independent and impartial judicial body.
the judge announced that a joint regional workshop was being planned to take place in ghana later this year to disseminate information on the work of both the authority and the tribunal to government officials from the region of west africa. 
regional groups’ statements
nigeria said the african group welcomed efforts and initiatives that would facilitate the development of the mining code for contractors ready and willing to move to the next stage of exploitation.  the group called on contractors to carry out their obligations with utmost dedication and make available all necessary information and data to assist the work of the authority. nigeria said the group recognized the quality leadership provided by secretary-general nii allotey odunton who, he described as “a distinguished african and pride of the continent”.
speaking on behalf of the asian and pacific states, fiji paid homage to ambassador arvid pardo of malta and other forefathers of the authority. the representative spoke of the responsibility of the authority to manage the natural resources of the area while preserving the marine environment.
russian federation foreign minister sergey lavrov, in a message to the authority’s secretary-general on the occasion, said the authority had gained “a firm hold as a reputable international organization” that effectively ensured the implementation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea with the purpose of managing the deep seabed area and its resources that formed the common heritage of mankind.
the russian federation, as one of the main contractors, highly valued the work done by the authority in organizing and controlling activities in the area. russia attached special importance to the efforts to elaborate and improve the legal basis of cooperation for the development of the area’s resources and rules for searching and prospecting. it was important that account was taken of the interests and needs of developing and least developed states, as well as applicable standards in the sphere of ecological safety and protection of the marine environment. he assured the secretary-general of russia’s “firm intention” to be actively involved in the work of the authority.    the message was read by the representative of russian federation who is chair of the eastern european group.
speaking on behalf of the latin american and caribbean group, mexico said that the best way to honour the work of those who were instrumental in establishing the authority would be to reaffirm the commitment of its members to undertake the new challenges ahead. the representative added that mechanisms were needed to evaluate and manage the environmental impact of mining operations as well as financial rules related to the benefits of exploitation. he noted the importance of taking into account the needs of developing countries.
mexico also noted with satisfaction at the increase in the number of permanent representatives to the authority, most of which were members of the group.
speaking on behalf of the western european and others group, the representative of germany noted that the convention was the radiant result of the great effort undertaken by the international community to conceive a universal legal framework for the oceans. he stated that this “constitution of the oceans, in the face of the challenges inherent in its activities, had proven both efficient and flexible.
furthermore, he pointed to the commitment of members of the western european and others group to the authority, reflected in the fact that seven of the exploration contracts approved had been sponsored by member states of this group, adding that they had also implemented cooperation projects with international partners and particularly developing states.
he added that this period marking the end of the first exploration contracts and the progress towards the exploitation phase brought new challenges that western european and others group was ready to take on along with the authority
afternoon meeting
on the resumption of the session following the lunch break, delegates were treated to a musical presentation by a youth group collegium musicum jamaica.  mr. mumba kapumpa, ambassador of zambia to south korea, was the first speaker after the break. he traced the birth and early development of the authority noting the spirit of compromise and the corporation that permeated. he said land-locked states compromised on almost every issue. “everything we did was by way of compromise”, he told the assembly. mr. kapumpa said the united nations convention on the law of the sea was intended to provide “a calmness of the oceans” following conflict in deliberations between states over issues of the deep seabed. celebrating the authority’s achievements twenty years later, he confirmed the seas “are calmer.”
describing the special session as a ceremonial handing over by the pioneers to those who have come after 1994, mr. kapumpa praised the secretary-general for his ability to calm situations and for always being available to assist delegations to arrive at consensus.
baïdy diène who served as president of the authority (2014) was a member of the legal and technical commission (2002-2011) said he was privileged to witness the conception, birth and evolution of the authority. he recognized the work of those who pioneered the creation of the authority saying they faced many problems but had found solutions through consensus to advance the work of the organisation. mr. diène also praised the “enlightened leadership” of the two secretary-generals, (satya n. nandan (1996-2008) and nii allotey odunton, the current secretary-general). like other delegations he emphasised the importance of training to benefit developing states especially and hoped that, with twenty-six contractors training would flourish.
speaking on behalf of the pacific small island developing states (psids), tonga described the close relationship between the oceans and the lives and livelihoods of the peoples of the pacific islands. he suggested that this was one of the reasons that all psids were parties of the convention and had committed themselves to its principles. the representative said that the state of the marine environment was deteriorating rapidly, so the twentieth anniversary of authority was a good opportunity to recommit to the preservation and equitable utilization of marine resources.
the representative of mexico spoke of the important role played by the oceans in human life, saying that states had an undeniable responsibility to protect them for future generations.  he commended the authority for its efforts to forge a strong relationship between developed and developing nations with regard to marine scientific research and resource exploration in the area.
trinidad and tobago said that in elaborating regulations for the exploitation of deep seabed minerals, member states must insist on the formulation of “robust provisions to safeguard the marine environment.” it added that the authority must make progress in developing environmental management plans to govern activities in the area, particularly for those zones for which exploration contracts were in force.
the authority also had a role to play, the trinidad and tobago representative noted, in shaping the implementation agreement being considered under the aegis of the un general assembly, relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. he added that as a matter of priority, the legal and technical commission should be mandated to begin working on policies to give effect to article 82 of the convention, which he characterized as dormant. (article 82 requires states parties to make payment or contributions in respect of the resource of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles).
indonesia noted that it had been involved with the authority since ambassador hasjim djalal was appointed as the first president of the assembly. the representative said his country would continue to support the work of the authority which, he said, was making good progress in the right direction.
south africa said that the principle of the common heritage of mankind was about “solidarity in the preservation and conservation of a good” to be shared by all for the benefit of all. it added that in moving toward the exploitation phase it was important to establish a fiscal framework for mining that was fair to industry, investors, member states and all mankind.
bangladesh, speaking for the first time in the assembly, pointed out that it was among the 119 member states who became signatories to the convention on the first day it was opened for signature.  the representative took the opportunity to inform the assembly that the dispute concerning delimitation of the maritime boundary between bangladesh, india and myanmar in the bay of bengal had been settled by the international tribunal for the law of the sea (itlos).
 
he said the ruling represented a victory for all three countries by peacefully resolving an issue that had hampered their economic development for over three decades.
the representative of fiji noted that when his country ratified the convention in 1982, it was seen as a just and equitable governance system for the world’s oceans. there had been no cause for disappointment, he said, adding that the convention had become embedded in the affairs of nations and continued to serve as a guide in other areas of law.
the representative of cuba said her delegation saw the authority as an essential instrument for maintaining and strengthening peace, order and sustainable development in oceans and seas. cuba had in the last twenty years made huge efforts to implement national strategies for sustainable development and the protection of the marine environment. cuba reiterated the importance of strengthening international cooperation in the management of marine resources and the care of the oceans and their biodiversity, duly respecting the jurisdiction of states over their territorial sea and the management of resources in their exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.  
india referred to the convention as an instrument containing several revolutionary elements. it confirmed its commitment to facilitating training for participants from developing countries, and spoke of a workshop to be held in india later this year to assist contractors to prepare estimates of mineable sites within exploration areas.
the philippines described the convention as playing a key role in ensuring global peace and cooperation. panama renewed its commitment to the authority, which it described as the product of one of the most important and far-reaching instruments in international law, namely the convention. st kitts and nevis commended the authority for its commitment to preserve the world’s rich marine heritage. in the final intervention from a member state, jamaica committed to continue to fulfil its obligations as host country in spite of limited resources.
the representative of senegal said that his country and six others were working on a joint submission to be made to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf (clcs) for an extension of the continental shelf. he expressed appreciation to the government of norway for its assistance in beginning the submission process, adding that the deposit of the joint request would be an example of regional as well as north-south cooperation.
guyana informed the assembly that on 6 september 2011, her country had made a submission for an extended continental shelf in accordance with article 76, paragraph 8, of the convention. the country was still awaiting a ruling on the matter.
brazil stated that it had sponsored an application for approval of a plan of work for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, which showed its commitment to the growth and consolidation of the authority.
four observers also spoke at the session. they are greenpeace international, world wildlife fund international, international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources, and deep sea conservation coalition.  the organisations highlighted the impact of climate change on the oceans and the importance of transparency in the authority’s operations.
the assembly meets today, 23 july, to consider the annual report of the secretary-general of the authority. before that meeting the authority’s council will convene briefly to adopt a draft decision relating to the summary report of the chair of the legal and technical commission.

speaking at the seminar on exploration and exploitation of deep seabed minerals resources in the area : challenges for africa, the deputy to the secretary-general of the international seabed authority, michael lodge paid tribute to the 1974 declaration of the organization of african unity on issues of the law of the sea in which african states reaffirmed their belief in the principle of the common heritage, including the need to distribute equitably among all developing countries the proceeds from any financial levies imposed on deep seabed mining, to protect the marine environment, and give full meaning to the concept of the common heritage of mankind.
at the same time, mr lodge also expressed concern over the lack of participation by african states in recent years especially with the 26 deep sea exploration contracts approved by the authority, 14 were with contractors sponsored by the asia-pacific states, 7 with contractors sponsored by western european states, 4 with contractors sponsored by eastern european states and 1 by the group of latin american and caribbean states. no application sponsored by an african state has yet been received.  
mr lodge said african states participation was particularly acute at this time as the authority has entered into the crucial task of preparing the rules and regulations for future exploitation of deep sea minerals. the successful completion of the exploitation code could not be done without the effective participation of the african countries.
also speaking at the seminar, the honourable deputy minister for mineral resources of the republic of south africa, mr. godfrey oliphant said south africa was privileged to play a part in assisting the authority in its outreach and informing relevant stakeholders of its crucial mandate and important work in strengthening the multilateral processes for the governance of the world’s oceans.
mr oliphant said the marine environment was particularly important to africa and its people. as the second biggest continent, africa’s coastline is over 26 000 nautical miles with the 38 african countries either coastal or island states. 
he said african countries needed to take up their rightful place, not only in the work of the authority, but also in sharing the potential benefits of mineral exploitation in the international seabed, as well as in relevant marine research projects and results. he continued that it was also important to be fully aware of the opportunities for capacity building and technology transfer provided by contractors as part of their obligations for mineral exploration in the international deep seabed, as well as by the authority’s endowment fund for marine scientific research.
the seminar is being held in tshwane, south africa from 17-19 march and is the ninth sensitization seminar to be convened by the international seabed authority in different countries around the world, and the second to be held on the continent of africa. 
these seminars are an important means of outreach for the authority to inform the countries of the region and the various ministries and departments in the host country of the work of the authority and other related international institutions, the latest developments in deep seabed mining and other topics of relevance.

ms walker stated that there was no overlap between the competencies of the two organs. the draft regulations was a matter under the competence of the commission whereas the committee had exclusive competence to make recommendations to the council on rules, regulations and procedures on the equitable sharing of financial and other economic benefits derived from activities in the area.
she said the joint meeting discussed the areas for which both the commission and the committee could collaborate as indicated in isba/24/c/10 on “functions of the organs of the authority in relation to the preparation of rules regulations and procedures on exploitation of mineral resources in the area and in relation to the system of compensation envisaged under article 151(10)of losc.”

on the development of the mining code, the isa secretary-general highlighted that important background work has been undertaken pending the moment where the council will be able to meet again physically and resume its work on this matter. this includes major work on the financial and economic model for seabed mining, as well as a study in relation to the proposed environmental compensation fund.

mr lodge also emphasized the ambitious programme of online workshops on the development of regional environmental management plans and related matters, including standardization for taxonomic identification as well as data collection and analysis, launched by isa in the past months. “the reaction to these workshops has been overwhelmingly positive, with widespread participation from leading scientists worldwide as well as a broad range of member states,” noted the secretary-general. “in presenting this ambitious programme, we have not only created a significant body of new scientific work that will help to protect the marine environment, but we have also created a new model for transparent and inclusive scientific collaboration that will be used in future to supplement  traditional approaches,” added mr lodge.

the secretary-general also highlighted important progress in the development of a draft communications and stakeholder engagement strategy which will soon be released for public consultations. he also indicated that isa has joined forces to achieve shared objectives in important international initiatives such as the current work led by the united nations global compact and the launch of its ocean stewardship 2030 report and; the adoption of the roadmap for accelerated implementation of the vienna programme of action for landlocked developing countries, led by the office of the high representative for the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states (un-ohrlls).

significant development has also been made in the perspective of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development, starting in 2021. a draft action plan has been developed and will be presented for adoption by the isa assembly before the end of 2020. the isa secretary-general further underscored that he was “particularly pleased that argentina has announced its willingness to act as a champion for the authority’s own action plan for marine scientific research in support of the un decade.” 

in its progress report, mr. michael w. lodge urged for the election of the incoming members of the council so that they can fulfil their tasks for 2021. “this is a matter that has always been dealt with by consensus, as required by the convention and the 1994 agreement, and there should be no reason why this cannot be done in 2020,” he added.

finally, mr. michael w. lodge underlined the importance for isa to adopt a budget, based on the recommendation of the finance committee which also completed its work. “without a budget, the authority will be unable to function and all activities will cease. i look forward to the budget progressing smoothly through the council and the assembly and urge all members to take a pragmatic and flexible approach in the interests of the authority,” he said.

he added that the convention takes a holistic approach to the protection of the marine environment.
“this essential reality is recognized by the convention itself, which in its third preambular paragraph reminds us that ‘the problems of ocean space are interrelated and need to be considered as a whole.” 
“to address these problems, the fundamental frame of reference within the convention is the marine environment as a whole. it is worth noting that the convention places no boundaries on the protection it gives to the marine environment. thus, it brings within its purview the adverse effects on the marine environment from activities on land and in the atmosphere.”
mr ascencio-herrera pointed out that while the ocean space is subject to the environmental protection obligations in part xii, the convention deals with the implementation and enforcement of those obligations based on the strict jurisdictional boundaries established in other parts of the convention. these boundaries may be geographic, as in the different maritime zones, or established by reference to the functional competence to regulate certain activities.
 in this regard, he highlighted that it is essential therefore, that the conference does not overlook or undermine the existing provisions of the convention, and that it fully respect the rights and jurisdictions carefully elaborated in the convention.

the exploration contract was signed on friday, 12 may in beijing, china by the secretary-general of the international seabed authority, michael lodge and the chairman of china minmetals corporation, he wenbo. 
the allocated area covers a surface area of 72,745 km2 of the clarion-clipperton fracture zone in the pacific ocean.
at the signing ceremony, secretary-general lodge said  ""china, and indeed the whole world, is facing a tremendous challenge – how can we meet an increasing metal demand in an environmentally sustainable way? in two weeks’ time, we shall be meeting at the united nations in new york to discuss the challenges for the implementation of sustainable development goal 14; the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources"". 
""if we are serious about developing a blue economy, based on sustainable use of marine resources, and a low carbon future, we are going to need an increased supply of metals for the world economy. renewable technologies for example require two to three times more steel per megawatt generated that conventional infrastructure. increased supplies of strategic metals such as cobalt and tellurium will also be needed "". 
""we also need to acquire these minerals without increasing our overall carbon footprint"".
china  is also sponsoring another contractor with the authority for the exploration for polymetallic nodules in the clarion clipperton zone since 2001, and for which a five-year extension was signed recently between secretary-general lodge and comra secretary-general liu feng.
china also sponsors comra in contracts for exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the southwest indian ridge and for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the west pacific ocean.

the draft regulations on exploitation of mineral resources in the area (isba/25/c/wp.1) require that certain issues are addressed in accordance with, or taking into account, standards and guidelines to be developed by the organs of the isa. the standards will be legally binding on contractors and the isa, whereas the guidelines will be recommendatory in nature.

during the 25th session of the isa, the council requested that the legal and technical commission (ltc) undertake work on standards and guidelines as a matter of priority, noting the proposed process and schedule for the development of standards and guidelines contained in isba/25/c/19/add.1, annex and enclosures i and ii. the ltc recommended a three-phase approach, as follows:

phase 1: standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place by the time of adoption of the draft regulations on exploitation.
	phase 2: standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place prior to the receipt of an application of a plan of work for exploitation.
	phase 3: standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place before commercial mining activities commence in the area
the process recommended by the ltc for the development of these standards and guidelines includes the circulation of the drafts for stakeholder consultations. information on the lists of documents currently available for consultation and the instructions for submission can be accessed here: https://bit.ly/3j3glky.

at isa’s 26th session, having advanced its consideration of a number of standards and guidelines under phase 1, the ltc developed and decided to put forward the first set of draft standards and guidelines for stakeholder consultations.

members and observers of the authority as well as contractors are hereby invited to submit their comments on the drafts to the secretariat at ola@isa.org.jm using the dedicated review template by 20 october 2020.

the draft is a first step toward consolidating the views of the authority’s stakeholder base following a number of stakeholder consultation initiatives in 2015, workshops and technical discussion papers issued by the authority.
the working draft represents the first phase in the development of a full suite of regulations that will include inter alia rules, regulations and procedures relating to environmental assessment and management, the setting up of a mining directorate and inspectorate and the equitable sharing of the receipts from mining activities.
the commission considers the draft as work in progress and that it does not represent the final views of the commission. at this stage the commission is seeking the views and opinions on the content and structure (as opposed to any fine-tuning of the drafting language) of the working draft from the authority’s stakeholder base. 
these views will be presented to the newly elected commission in february 2017 together with a revised working draft. it is intended that the next commission will formulate a clear methodology with regard to the elaboration of the mining code, timelines and stakeholder contribution in the regulatory content and drafting process in connection with regulatory development. additionally, subsequent development of the mining code will also reflect any recommendations adopted by the authority flowing from the current article 154 review.
in the meantime, the current commission will recommend to the council, for their consideration at the 22nd session of the authority, a number of action areas to advance the further development of the mining code.
members of the authority and all stakeholders are invited to comment on the working draft.
the closing date of responses to the working draft is wednesday, 2nd november 2016 at 1800hr (est). submissions can be sent via email (in either word or pdf format) to consultation@isa.org.jm or by post to:

revised from a 32-paragraph document submitted by brazil on the basis of comments and contributions by members of the council, the draft decision (isba/20/c/l.10) is a streamlined consensus text formulated during informal group consultations on monday, 21 july.
brazil, who thanked delegations for helping to produce a more concise document for the council to adopt, recommended that the paragraphs left out from the previous draft could be included in a report to the assembly by the president of the council – a point on which other delegations agreed. france said it would allow the decision to go forward but felt there were some paragraphs that were more suited for the president’s report.
the decision reads as follows:
 by the draft decision, the council requested the commission “as a matter of urgency and as its priority” to formulate draft procedures and criteria for applications for extension of contracts for exploration, to be submitted to the council at its 2015 session, in accordance with section 3.2 of the standard clauses contained in annex 4 to the regulations. this was to be applied in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner to all requests for extension of contracts for exploration. the commission’s text was to be made available in advance of the council’s 2015 session.
the council took note, with appreciation, of the summary report of the chair of the commission on its work during the twentieth session and requested the commission to continue its elaboration of the exploitation regulations as a matter of priority. a draft framework was to be made available to all members of the authority and all stakeholders as soon as possible after the commission’s february 2015 meeting.
the commission was requested to consider, as appropriate, the submission by
the netherlands on environmental management plans and environmental impact assessments in the regulatory framework for mineral exploitation in the area (isba/20/c/13) in the context of its work on the preparation of draft regulations for exploitation in the area.
by the text, the council called the attention of contractors to the issues raised and recommendations made by the commission on their annual reports.
the commission was asked to examine ways to ensure that training opportunities effectively considered the interests and needs of developing states, particularly the landlocked and geographically disadvantaged among them, in accordance with article 148 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, and recommendations on training programmes embodied in plans of work of contractors and sponsoring states.
the council requested the commission to continue to work on issues related to the sponsorship by states of exploration contracts in the area, with particular attention to a test of effective control, as well as with issues related to monopolization of activities in the area, considering, in particular, the concept of abuse of a dominant position.
furthermore, the council requested the commission to submit for its approval, not later than its 2016 session, draft procedures on the handling of confidential data and information, as provided for in rule 12 of its own rules of procedure. its secretariat was encouraged to continue their work, up to and beyond 2015, on the implementation of the environmental management plan for the clarion-clipperton zone.
the commission was encouraged to consider developing environmental management plans in other international seabed area zones, in particular where there were currently exploration contracts, in line with the suggestion by the united nations general assembly in paragraph 51 of its resolution 68/70.  all contractors were encouraged to make their environmental data readily and publicly available.
the commission was asked to continue exploring initiatives to increase transparency and dialogue on the development of its work, in particular on issues of general interest to member states and other stakeholders of the authority.
finally, the council also requested the secretary-general to ensure that adequate time and resources continued to be made available to support the commission’s work, especially on priority issues.
the representative of the netherlands drew attention to the statement of the president of the council of the international seabed authority on the work of the council during the nineteenth session (isba/19/c/18). paragraph 17 of the report read, in part:
the council further requested the legal and technical commission to review the provisions of the three sets of regulations relating to the monopolization of activities in the area and the option of offering an equity interest in a joint venture arrangement with a view to aligning all three sets of regulations in this respect, and to make a recommendation thereon for consideration by the council at its twentieth session in 2014.
the netherlands said the council could either add this request as a paragraph in the current draft decision or the president could ask the commission to report on the matter at the next session.
the authority’s legal counsel said netherland’s point was important and that the matter was mentioned in the summary report of the commission in the context of issues relating to the operation of the enterprise, in paragraph 34. he said the president’s report could emphasise the points raised by the netherlands.
the russian federation said there was a translation error on the last line of paragraph 2 of the decision that changed the meaning in russian and asked that it be corrected.
fiji said it supported the 12-paragraph draft decision but needed clarification on the term “geographically disadvantaged” in reference to developing states in paragraph 6. brazil noted that the term appeared in part xi of the united nations convention on the law of the sea. more precisely, trinidad and tobago said the term appeared in article 148 of the convention – participation of developing states in activities of the area. the representative of trinidad and tobago said while his delegation would not want to change the current wording of the decision, he hoped that in future decisions the term “small island developing states” could be included in language of decisions of the council.
on the matter of future meetings of the council, brazil, supported by the netherlands, felt there should be an option for the regulatory body of the authority to convene more frequent meetings when necessary, particularly to deal with pending new regulations.
before closing the final meeting for the twentieth session, president of the council, tommo monthe (cameroon) hailed the cooperation that prevailed among delegations and allowed the council to complete its 17-point agenda. “we need this spirit of cooperation to ensure the success of our work now and in the future”, he said.
highlights of the council session
a highlight of the council’s session was the adoption of a draft decision (isba/20/c/l.2) by which the assembly would approve us$ 15,743,143 for the authority’s operations for the biennium 2015-2016.
the draft decision, based on recommendations of the finance committee, was amended to include two additional paragraphs, one urging members of the committee to fulfil their obligations to attend its meetings. the other would request the secretary-general to provide in future a complete narrative in support of his budget proposals, including a breakdown of projected costs for large items of expenditure, and to ensure that the budget was in line with the priorities set by both the council and the assembly. an existing paragraph was also amended to express appreciation to those members of the authority who have made voluntary contributions to the voluntary trust fund and the international seabed authority endowment fund.
the council, at its second meeting of the session, took note of two reports of the secretary-general. one report addressed the status of prospecting and contract for exploration for three types of mineral resources in the seabed area- polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts (20/c/12 and isba/20/c/12/add.1). it included information on the status of the periodic review of the implementation of the exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules between the international seabed authority and the government of india.
the second report outlined laws, regulations, and administrative measures adopted by sponsoring states and other members of the authority with respect to activity in the area.
the council examined procedures for possible extension of exploration contracts and mechanisms for the formulation of regulations for exploitation in the area during discussions of a summary report of the chair of the legal and technical commission on its february and july sessions.
the council adopted amendments to two separate regulations - prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides and prospecting and exploration for polymetallic nodules.
in other matters, it elected the czech republic to the remaining position for vice-president for the eastern european group, joining argentina (latin american and caribbean states), bangladesh (the asian group) and the netherlands (western european and others group) who were elected at the council’s first meeting.
ahead of the debate, the 36-member council received an explanatory note on the “environmental management plan in the regulatory framework for mineral exploitation in the area” (isba/20/c/13) prepared by the netherlands.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

the commission reported that it had considered six new applications for approval of plans of work for exploration and completed its recommendations in respect of two of them. the applicants are: china ocean mineral resources, research and development association (comra); japan oil. gas and metals national corporation (jogmec); ministry of natural resources and environment of the russian federation; uk seabed resources ltd; (uksrl); government of india; and ocean mineral singapore pty ltd., (oms).
 with regard to the status of contracts for exploration, the chairman noted that three contracts for exploration were pending signature and suggested that those contractors could be guided by the newly issued recommendations relating to training programmes under plan of work for exploration (isba/19/ltc/crp.7/rev.1). the remaining three applications would be taken up as a matter of priority at the commission’s next meeting in 2014.
in the light of the increased number of annual reports to be examined, the commission took the decision to streamline its working procedures. the new procedures included reviewing the annual reports at its first meeting each year to allow members of the commission’s working groups to prepare their work in advance of the annual session. additionally, as a result of a request made to the secretariat by the commission in february, annual reports had been made accessible through a secure website to designated members of the commission allowing them to work remotely. the chairman also noted that the secretariat had contracted a consultant to conduct a technical evaluation of the reports, including a detailed analysis of the contractor’s activities, which assisted the work of the commission.
on the annual reports of contractors, dr. howorth reported that all 11 contractors submitted their annual activity reports for the 2012 period in a timely manner, following the general template prescribed by the  legal and technical commission in 2002 (isba/8/ltc/2). however, there were inconsistencies in the quality of the reports. as such, the commission invited the secretariat to request the contractors to comply with the data submission requirements set out in isba/18/c/20.
the chairman noted that six additional contracts had either been signed during 2013 or were currently in the final stages of negotiation and thus the first reports from those contractors would be forthcoming in subsequent years. six more applications were currently being considered. he stated that some 17 annual reports would need to be considered in 2014. by 2015 there might be as many as 23 annual reports to be considered, which represented an increase of more than 100% in the commission’s workload.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

according to the new preliminary strategy for the development of regional environmental management plans for the area (isba/24/c/3), the objective of regional environmental management plans is to provide the relevant organs of the authority, as well as contractors and their sponsoring states, with a proactive area-based management tool to support informed decision-making that balances resource development with conservation. regional environmental management plans also provide the authority with a clear and consistent mechanism to identify particular areas thought to be representative of the full range of habitats, biodiversity and ecosystem structures and functions within the relevant management area, and provide those areas with appropriate levels of protection, thus helping the authority to meet internationally agreed targets, such as aichi biodiversity target 11.
workshop objectives will include the development of a reproducible and transparent procedure to:
share the available environmental data, and understand the national, regional and international policies and laws; 
find a consensus on the design of the remp as well as the preliminary ideas for its framework;
create a work plan for 2-3 years of scientific collaboration to collect additional data needed for the design of the remp;
discuss and sign an agreement (mou between the contractors and the secretary-general) on future steps for the establishment and implementation of the remp; 
discuss mechanisms for communication and coordination and to establish an organizational structure, if needed.
this and other remp workshops aim to contribute materially to the implementation of sustainable development goal 14, namely to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”, including, for example, by conserving at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine biodiversity (target 14.5). in addition, those areas may serve as scientific reference areas for monitoring natural variability and long-term change in the marine environment, which will be particularly important for enabling the authority to carry out its responsibility to manage the effects of mining activities.

other matters before the session include an interim report on the way the legal regime for the area had operated in accordance with article 154 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, and elections to the finance committee, legal and technical commission and council of the authority.
on the extension of contracts, six contracts issued by the authority in 2001 for the exploration for polymetallic nodules in the area will expire in 2016. the contractors have each applied for a five-year extension which were examined by the authority’s expert body, the legal and technical commission at its first session of 2016 (22 february to 4 march). the commission’s recommendations are expected to be considered by the authority’s executive council at its july session.
another priority item on the commission’s agenda was the development of the draft minerals exploitation regulations for which a time frame of 12 to 18 months for its completion was agreed upon in 2015. an initial draft text was scheduled to be circulated to all stakeholders in march 2016 for their comments and observations before its submission to the council in july 2016. 
the authority has since 2000 formulated and adopted regulations  for exploration  for polymetallic nodules in the area (adopted on 13 july 2000, and later updated and adopted 25 july 2013); polymetallic sulphides in the area (adopted 7 may 2010 and amended in 2013 and 2014); and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the area (adopted 27 july 2012 and amended in 2013). pursuant to these regulations, the legal and technical commission of the authority has issued recommendations for the guidance of contractors covering, among others, content, format and structure of their annual reports; exploration expenditure reporting; and assessment of environmental impacts resulting from their operations in the area. there is also a guide for contractors and sponsoring states on training programmes under plans of work for exploration. 
elections will be held during the session for a secretary-general of the authority for the period 2017-2020; half of the 36-member council; the 25-member legal and technical commission and also for the 15-member finance committee, whose terms of office, like those on the commission, expire on 31 december 2016.
the secretary-general would be elected from among a list to be proposed by the council. the candidates, so far, are the current secretary-general, nii allotey odunton (ghana), and the legal counsel and deputy to the secretary-general, michael lodge (united kingdom).   
  
officers of the twenty-second session to be elected will be a nominee of the asia and pacific group, for the presidency of the assembly; and a nominee of the eastern european states group for the presidency of the council. each of the other regional groups will nominate vice-presidents of the assembly and the council. a credentials committee will also be appointed.
established in 1994 with the entry into force that year by the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea, the authority administers the mineral resources of the deep seabed beyond areas of national jurisdiction (described by the convention as the area), and the sharing of the economic benefits with all states, including the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged. it is also required under the convention and the 1994 agreement relating to the implementation of part xi of the convention to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful activities.
finance committee.     
at its meetings before the opening of the session, the authority’s finance committee will consider the secretary-general’s proposed budget for the organization for the financial period 2017-2018, and review the implementation of the 2015-2016 budget and audited financial statements. it will also consider potential cost-saving measures taken by the authority since the last session. 
     
the committee will review the status of the authority’s working capital fund, the status of the international seabed authority endowment fund for marine scientific research in the area, the voluntary trust fund as well as the status of the implementation of the international public sector accounting standards. 
the finance committee members will take note of a report of the secretary-general (isba/22/fc/2) prepared in response to its request at the last session, on the possibility, from a legal perspective, of considering advances from the endowment fund to the voluntary trust fund to be grants.
the voluntary trust fund was established in 2002 to help members of the authority from developing countries participate fully in the meetings of the legal and technical commission and the finance committee. it is funded by members of the authority and others.
the endowment fund, established in 2006, promotes and encourages the conduct of marine scientific research in the area for the benefit of mankind as a whole. it carries this out by supporting the participation of qualified scientists and technical personnel from developing countries and also by providing them with opportunities to be involved in relevant initiatives.
according to the authority’s secretariat, as at 1 december 2015, a total of 76 scientists and government officials from 40 developing countries have obtained financial support from the endowment fund.  
an annex to the secretary-general’s report to the finance committee shows the total amounts transferred from the endowment fund to the voluntary trust fund to date. 
legal and technical commission
at its february 2016 meetings, the legal and technical commission focused on priority items on its agenda, including the applications for five-year extensions of the six contracts for exploration for polymetallic nodules in the area and the development of the minerals exploitation regulations.
the six contractors are: yuzhmorgeologiya sponsored by the russian federation, the interoceanmetal joint organization sponsored by bulgaria, cuba, czech republic, poland, the russian federation and slovakia, the government of the republic of korea, the china ocean mineral resources research and development association sponsored by china, deep ocean resources development co. ltd sponsored by japan, and the institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer. 
the commission examined the applications and its recommendations are expected to be submitted to the council at its july session. 
substantive work on the draft minerals exploitation regulations include a zero draft of the text, standard contract terms based on the working structure already greed upon and a technical implementation plan. to assist the commission, the secretariat has produced four discussion papers – available on its website - covering dispute resolution; data and information management; and the development of a communications and engagement strategy for the authority to ensure active stakeholder participation in the development of the exploitation code. 
also on the commission’s agenda are proposals on environmental impact assessment and their evaluation as well as other environmental issues which would be regulated by the code.
according to a report of the secretary-general (isba/22/c/5), 24 contracts for exploration had entered into force as at 27 april 2016 (15 for polymetallic nodules, 5 for polymetallic sulphides and 4 for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts).
the report also states that two new contracts had been signed since july 2015. they are a contract for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, signed with a brazilian company, companhia de pesquisa de recursos minerais s.a. in brasilia, on 9 november 2015; and a contract for exploration for polymetallic nodules signed with the uk seabed resources ltd. in new york on 29 march 2016. 
three other contracts are expected to be signed this year: one with the cook islands investment corporation for exploration for polymetallic nodules; another with the government of india for exploration for polymetallic sulphides; and the third with china minmetals corporation for exploration.  
the commission meetings which began today (4 to 11 july) will act on any new applications for approval of plans of work for exploration; review reports of exploration contractors as well as its own recommendations on possible environmental impacts arising from exploitation of marine minerals.
it will review reports on the outcomes and recommendations of workshops on the standardization of the taxonomy of the mega, macro and meiofauna associated with polymetallic nodules. the standardization is said to be relevant to the baseline biological data being gathered by contractors for polymetallic nodules, the environmental management plan for the clarion-clipperton fracture zone (ccz) in the pacific, the proposed impact and preservation zones and environmental impact assessment. 
 other matters referred to the commission last year by the council, but which were not acted upon due to time constraints, will be taken up at its july meetings. these include issues relating to the operation of the projected mining arm of the authority, the enterprise, and sponsorship by states of contracts for exploration in the area. 
christian reich (germany) and elva escobar-briones (mexico) were re-elected chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, of the commission at its first session in february.  
the legal and technical commission oversees seabed activities, including issue of recommendations on work plans, protection of the marine environment and the establishment of a pollution monitoring programme. it is also empowered to supervise, formulate and review regulations and procedures for seabed activities and to assess their environmental implications.
 council
among the 22 items listed on the provisional agenda of the council are reports of the finance committee and the chairman of the legal and technical commission on their deliberations in 2016. the council is expected to act on any specific recommendations of the commission, such as applications for extension of contracts for exploration. it will also consider a progress report on the commission’s elaboration of the minerals exploitation regulations, as well as its responses to matters the council had previously referred to it.       
other topics on the council’s agenda are the status of national legislation concerning deep seabed mining and related matters; legal questions concerning potential conflicts between the right of all states to carry out marine scientific research in the area and the authority’s obligations under exploration contracts. it will also make recommendations to the assembly on the finance committee’s proposals on the authority’s budget for the financial period 2017-2018 and the scale of assessment for contributions to it.
the council will elect members of the legal and technical commission for a new term of five years starting from 1 january 2017. the term of office of the current members ends on 31 december 2016. 
at the last session, a note of the secretary-general to the council on the elections ( isba/21/c/6) stressed the importance of the qualifications of the candidates, particularly the securing of appropriate combination of relevant expertise that would determine the effective discharge of the commission’s functions as it intensified its efforts to formulate a regulatory regime for minerals exploitation.  equally important, according to the note, was the issue of the independence of commission members and the avoidance of any actual or perceived conflict of interest. 
the first election of commission members was held in august 1996.  after failing to agree on the balance of regional representation on the commission, the council took advantage of a provision in the convention (article 163, paragraph 2) to increase the size of the commission from 15 to 22, without prejudice to future elections. the same procedure was repeated for the elections in 2001, 2006 and 2011. on each occasion, the council approved all the candidates submitted, increasing the number of seats on the commission from 15 to 24 in 2001 and to 25 in 2006 and 2011, without prejudice to future elections and the claims of the regional groups and interest groups.        
assembly
the assembly will consider the annual report of the secretary-general which is submitted pursuant to article 166 of the convention.  it will also consider an interim report of the committee it established in 2015 to undertake a general and systematic review of how the international regime of the area had operated in accordance with article 154 of the convention. the committee is chaired by helmut tuerk of austria, a former judge of the international tribunal on the law of the sea and president of the assembly at the authority’s 2015 session. 
article 154, part xi, of the convention provides that: “every five years from the entry into force of this convention, the assembly shall undertake a general and systematic review of the manner in which the international regime of the area established in this convention has operated in practice. in the light of this review the assembly may take, or recommend that other organs take measures, in accordance with the provisions and procedures of this part and the annexes relating thereto which will lead to the improvement of the operation of the regime.”
the committee’s terms of reference include, among others, a review of the manner in which the various organs and subsidiary bodies of the authority have operated in practice and whether they have carried it out effectively as stipulated in paragraph 5 of the annex to the 1994 agreement relating to the implementation of part xi of the convention.
the assembly will act on recommendations on the authority’s budget for the financial period 2017-2018 prepared by the finance committee and first considered by the council. 
in addition to electing members of the finance committee for a new term of office, the assembly will fill vacancies in the council: two in group a (major consumers or major net importers of metals; one in group b (major investors); two in group c (major net exporters and developing state major exporters); three in group d (group of special interests); and twelve vacancies in group e (members of regional groups), all for the period 2017 to 2020. the assembly, to which all members of the authority belong, will elect the secretary-general.

the government of nauru had sponsored an entity; nauru ocean resources  inc., for a plan of work in prospecting and exploration for polymetallic nodules in the area. 
in a communication to the authority (isba/16/c/6), it sought an advisory opinion on the interpretations of the relevant provisions of the united nations convention of the law of the sea and the 1994 agreement relating to the implementation of part xi of the convention (general assembly resolution 48/263) pertaining to the responsibility and the liability of sponsoring states.
speaking in council, the nauru representative said that while its sponsorship agreement with nauru ocean resources inc., conferred numerous powers upon the state, it believed the seabed disputes chamber might be able to clarify whether there were any additional measures it could take, and, if there were such measures, additional safeguards could then be incorporated into the sponsorship agreement.
he continued that an advisory opintion from the seabed disputes chamber would provide greater certainty to sponsoring states or those who intended to do so and would demonstrate to the private sector investors that there was a procedure to refer matters to a functioning tribunal that could adjudicate disputes regarding activities in the area. he said the advisory opinion could also help develop standards that must be observed in the area leading to the promotion of best practices and consequently the protection of the environment.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

the workshop focused on issues relating to the development of a sustainable deep sea mining industry and highlighted the urgent need far  an exploitation code, which would include a transitional financial regime with an initial payment mechanism comprising an annual flat fee and a royalty payment. 
several key environmental issues were identified such as the need for wide accessibility of scientific data and the need to clarify key environmental terms such as serious harm to the marine environment, cumulative impacts and the scope of environmental impact assessments. the benefits of facilitating participation by key stakeholders, including contractors, non-governmental  organizations (ngos) and other interested parties in relevant isa processes to develop the code were also emphasized.
the objective of the workshop was to canvas the main perspectives and concerns of stakeholder groups, continue the process of stakeholder participation in the development of a regulatory framework for mineral exploitation on the two key consultation documents issued by the isa in march 2015. the first, the draft framework for the regulation of exploitation activities, issued by the legal and technical commission (ltc). the second, the discussion paper, on the financial terms of exploitation contracts issued by the isa secretariat.
the workshop was opened by professor robert beckman, director, cil followed by a keynote address by the isa secretary-general, mr nii allotey odunton.
the sessions were co-chaired by mr michael lodge, isa deputy to the secretary-general and legal counsel and cil governing board chairman, professor tommy koh and was attended by 89 participants representing a cross section of stakeholders, contractors, state sponsors, ngos, academia including the isa secretariat and members of its legal and technical commission.

speaking at the 21st meeting of the states parties to the 1982 un convention on the law of the sea in new york, mr. nii a. odunton, the secretary-general of the international seabed authority said two of the four applications were for exploration of reserved areas by private sector entities sponsored by developing states - the first such applications to have been made, and as such, represent a new milestone in the life of the authority and for the regime for deep seabed mining under the convention and the 1994 agreement.
the other two applications pending consideration, sponsored by china and the russian federation respectively are also ground breaking in nature as they represent the first applications to have been made for contracts for exploration for polymetallic sulphides - a new type of mineral resource for which regulations were adopted by the authority in 2010.
mr odunton said these applications combined with the significantly increased interest on the part of private sector mining companies and deep ocean technology companies in participating in the seminars and workshops organized by the authority indicate a renewed commercial interest in deep seabed mining as an alternative source for the minerals needed to fuel economic development in many parts of the world.
""this is encouraging both for the authority and member states, who will be the ultimate beneficiaries from seabed mining"", he said.
mr odunton said the authority was also under pressure to deliver an appropriate level of protection for the area and the measures currently under consideration and also to be discussed in this regard at the 17th session include proposals for an environmental management plan at the regional scale for the clarion clipperton zone and proposals for the management of chemosynthetic environments in the global ocean.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

the urgent need to begin elaboration of regulations for the exploitation of minerals from the deep seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction was a central theme at the international seabed authority’s twentieth anniversary session in kingston (14-25 july 2014).

as the inter-governmental body wound up its session thursday, 24 july, a day earlier than originally scheduled, its council signaled it wanted formulation of procedures and criteria for applications for extension of exploration contracts as well as exploitation regulations to be given top priority.

 the council, by a decision adopted on 23 july requested the authority’s expert body, the legal and technical commission, to, “as a matter of urgency and as its priority” to formulate the draft texts and submit them to the council at its 2015 session. the draft instruments would be applied in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner and made available in advance of the council’s next session in 2015. the commission is scheduled to meet in kingston in february 2015.

the authority’s assembly, at its final meeting on thursday, 24 july, decided to convene the 21st session of the authority from 13 to 24 july 2015 in kingston.

during debate on the proposals in the council, many delegations expressed support for formulation of the draft texts. a proposal by the netherlands for the incorporation of environmental management planning in the regulatory framework for mineral exploitation in the area was welcomed by delegations. the commission was requested to consider it in the context of its work on the instrument.

exploration contracts awarded to the pioneer investors in 2001 and 2002 will come to an end in 2016 and 2017. some of the contractors involved are likely to proceed to exploitation while others might apply for extension of their contracts. there is now a significant increase in the level of interest in deep seabed mining.

 the legal and technical commission (ltc) has already laid the groundwork for the preparation of draft regulations for exploitation in the area. a stakeholder survey was launched by the authority’s secretariat in march 2014, with an input from the commission, to solicit relevant information for the development of a regulatory framework for the exploitation of minerals in the area. a draft framework has been prepared by the secretariat based on a detailed analysis of the 55 responses to the survey.

summary report of ltc chairman

 according to a summary report by its chairman, russell howorth (fiji), the legal and technical commission held two sessions in 2014, from 3 to13 february and from 7 to 16 july, holding 32 formal meetings in total.

 the commission’s report, (isba/20/c/20) covered the following activities of contractors, including; the status of prospecting and of contracts for exploration, annual reports of contractors; the periodic review of implementation of plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules; extension of contracts for exploration and implementation of training programmes and allocation of training opportunities.

 other matters dealt with in the report are applications for approval of plans of work for exploration in the area, status of implementation of the environmental management plan for the clarion-clipperton zone, conflict of interest of commission members and the future data management strategy of the authority.

the report also covered matters referred to the commission by the council, such as issues relating to monopolization of activities in the area and the operation of the future enterprise, the mining arm of the authority, particularly legal, technical and financial implications for the authority and for states parties.

during discussions of the report over three meetings, some council members called upon the contractors to comply fully with their contractual obligations.  the commission was urged to review and update the template for the annual reports of contractors, and also examine ways to ensure that training opportunities took account of the interests and needs of developing countries, particularly the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged states, as well as small island developing states.

status of prospecting, exploration contracts

at its meeting on 21 july 2014, the council approved seven plans of work for exploration in the seabed area, recommended by the legal and technical commission. it requested the secretary-general to issue the plans of work in the form of contracts between the international seabed authority and each of the applicants respectively.

 during a debate on the status of prospecting, exploration contracts, periodic review and overhead charge, it was noted that as of 24 june 2014, the authority had concluded 12 contracts for exploration for polymetallic nodules; three for polymetallic sulphides and two for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, thus bringing the number of exploration contracts issued by the authority to 17. two plans of work approved in 2012 still remain pending for signature of contracts.

there was concern that some contractors had not yet accepted the new standard clauses on overhead charges established by the assembly last year to cover the costs of administration and supervision of contracts.

transparency and openness 
 
there was discussion of the issue of “transparency and openness” as an essential element in the commission’s work and that of the authority as a whole. it was recommended that the commission should continue to explore initiatives, including holding open meetings and publishing surveys, particularly on issues of general interest to ensure broad participation.

the secretariat was commended for its work in developing a global deep seabed database as was the legal and technical commission’s decision to keep the subject of data management on its agenda as a regular item.

amendments to regulation 21

the council adopted recommendations of the commission for amendments to regulation 21 of the regulations on prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the area (isba/20/c/22). in another action, the council, with a view to aligning the regulation on monopolization embodied in the regulation on nodules with that of the regulations on sulphides and on crusts, adopted a decision (isba/20/c/23) by which regulation 21 of the regulations on prospecting and exploration for polymetallic nodules in the area was amended by the insertion of a new paragraph immediately following paragraph 6 and renumber of paragraphs 7 to 11 of the regulations accordingly.  the assembly later approved the amendments.

report of finance committee

the assembly on the recommendations of the committee and the council approved a budget of us$15,743,143 for the authority’s operations for the financial period 2015-2016 and related matters (isba/20/a/l.2). the secretary-general was authorized to establish the scale of assessments for 2015 and 2016 on the basis of that used for the regular budget of the expenses of the united nations for 2013-2014 respectively. it would take into account that the ceiling assessment rate would be 22 per cent and the floor rate 0.01 per cent.

 acting on recommendations of the council, the assembly urged the authority’s members to pay their assessed contributions to the budget on time and in full. the assembly appealed to those in arrears to pay their outstanding contributions from previous years as soon as possible.

the assembly requested the secretary-general to provide, in future, a complete narrative in support of budget proposals, as well as a breakdown of projected costs in respect of large items of expenditure or those in which a significant variance in relations to the previous budget was proposed. the secretary-general was also to ensure that the budget was in line with the priorities set by the council and the assembly.

secretary-general’s report

the annual report of the secretary-general, nii allotey odunton (ghana) (isba/20/a/2), was the focus of a two-day debate in the assembly. the report, submitted under article 166 paragraph 4 of the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea, provided information on the work of the authority from july 2013 to june 2014. it covered, among others, administrative and financial matters, the authority’s relations with the host government, jamaica, and status of contracts for exploration in the area.

presenting the report to the assembly on 23 july, mr. odunton highlighted the challenge of managing the increasing workload of the authority as it moved towards elaborating exploitation regulations and the need for standardized data on the living resources of the seabed area.

the secretary-general noted that with seven new contracts having been approved at the session, bringing the total number of contracts to 26, the workload of the legal and technical commission would increase significantly. he suggested that the authority should consider how the commission’s work would be managed in the future.

the report observed that the authority had achieved significant milestones since 2000. it had “cemented its place” as the central body to organize and control activities in the seabed area beyond national jurisdiction. it had adopted and implemented three sets of regulations for exploration for polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides, and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, and had also entered into contracts for exploration for all three different resources.

relationship with the host government

the report said the secretariat had continued to actively seek redress from the government of jamaica, the host country, to the long-standing problems of the poor condition of the authority’s headquarters building as previously reported by the secretary-general. whilst the government had addressed some of those issues, the problem of the inconsistent water supply and the poor performance of the air-conditioning units remained unresolved. additionally, in spite of the efforts made by the jamaica conference centre to improve the audio system there were still interruptions experienced during the meetings of the legal and technical commission in february 2014.
            
the relationship between the authority and the host government is governed by a headquarters agreement, which entered into force on 26 august 1999, and a supplementary agreement relating to the occupation of the headquarters of the authority, which entered into force on 2 june 2004.

financial matters

the secretary-general pointed out that the overhead charge of $47,000 to be payable annually by contractors to cover the administration and supervision of contracts and review of their annual reports, would lead to a significant decrease (approximately $1.8 million) in the amount of the budget that would have to be financed by member states.
 
as at 30 april 2014, 68.7 per cent of the value of contributions to the 2014 budget due from member states and the european community had been received from 29.7 per cent of the authority’s membership. contributions outstanding from member states for prior periods (1998-2013) amounted to us$ 283,731. as at 30 april 2014, 43 members of the authority were in arrears for a period of two years or more, and would consequently have no vote in accordance with article 184 of the convention and rule 80 of the rules of procedure of the assembly.  the secretary general urged all members in arrears to take the necessary steps to pay their contributions.

also as at the same date, the balance of the authority’s working capital fund stood at us$ 556,522 against an approved level of us$ 560,000.

voluntary trust fund

the voluntary trust fund (vtf) for the participation in the work of the finance committee and the legal and technical commission by members from developing countries was established in 2002. the total amount paid out of the fund as at 22 july 2014, was us$527,126. the balance of the fund as at the same date stood at $237,101.

the fund is made up of voluntary contributions from members of the authority and others. over the life of the fund, contributions totalling us$562,924 have been paid into it. the most recent contributions to the fund were made by japan ($44,760) in september 2013, norway ($99,224.39) in june 2014 and china ($20,000) in july 2014.

endowment fund for marine scientific research in the area

the endowment fund for marine scientific research in the area was established by the assembly in 2006 (isba/12/a/11). the endowment fund promotes and encourages the conduct of marine scientific research in the seabed area for the benefit of mankind as a whole, in particular by supporting the participation of qualified scientists and technical personnel from developing countries in marine scientific research programmes.

since the authority’s nineteenth session, two awards have been made from the fund. the first award of $30,000 was made to the rhodes academy to help fund a number of fellowships for students from developing countries and to expand the academy’s training programmes to cover issues relating to deep seabed marine science. as at 31 may 2014, 59 scientists or government officials from developing countries have been beneficiaries of financial support from the endowment fund. 

the secretary-general described the endowment fund as a very useful mechanism of the authority. he outlined a strategy being used to increase its capital. he said that after an application for a plan of work had been processed, the secretariat would inform the applicant about the cost and request that any remaining balance be applied to the fund.

as at 30 april 2014, the capital of the fund stood at $3,417,038, and a total of $428,932 had been disbursed form the interest accrued on the capital.
.library, publications and website

the satya n. nandan library, named after the authority’s first secretary-general, is the main information resource for the secretariat and for member states and other individuals and institutions looking for specialist information on seabed resources and legal and political issues relating to the deep sea. the library manages the authority’s specialized collection of reference and research materials which focused on matters relating to the law of the sea, ocean affairs and deep sea mining

the most recent major upgrade to the facilities of the library was done during the renovation of the headquarters in 1999. it was anticipated that by july 2014, the public access area of the library would have been updated with a new reception area and improved reading areas.

at the end of 2013, the authority launched a new publications strategy which uses a combination of print-on-demand and electronic publishing technology to reduce costs through streamlining publishing practices.

the authority’s website was currently being upgraded and redeveloped to better manage and disseminate the various aspects of its work to member states, its various organs and the public at large. the restructured website will be compatible with cross-browser platforms and will also be accessible on mobile devices. during the reporting period, the ict unit developed and deployed an extranet accessible to members of the legal and technical commission which allowed secure collaboration among members. at the commission’s request, an electronic log was also developed to record the submission of documents and communications by contractors to facilitate inventory, search and production of various reports.

status of contracts for exploration in the area

as at 19 may 2014, 16 exploration contracts were in force, covering approximately 900,000 kilometres of the seafloor in the atlantic, indian and pacific oceans. twelve contracts cover exploration for polymetallic nodules, two for polymetallic sulphides and two for cobalt-rich crusts.

the secretary-general noted that with seven new contracts having been approved at this session, taking the total number contracts to 26, the workload of the commission would increase significantly. he estimated that the time needed just to review the annual reports of all the contractors would be at least 13 days, more time than was currently allocated to the commission to complete its entire agenda for the year. he suggested that the authority should begin to consider how the work would be managed in the future.

election to the council
 
 the assembly, in an uncontested election, renewed almost half the membership of the authority’s 36-member council, for a four-year term from 2015 through 2018. 

the council is composed of five groups of states members of the authority, four of which have special interests in aspects of seabed mining. the fifth ensures equitable geographical balance in the council as a whole.

 those elected in accordance with the convention on the law of the sea and assembly decisions, are:

group a:   italy and russian federation. (italy would relinquish its seat in group a in favour of the united states if the latter became a member of the authority; this does not prejudice the position of any country with respect to any intervening election to the council).

group b:   france, germany and republic of korea. (germany was re-elected for a period of four years (2015-2018), on the understanding that belgium will occupy the seat in group b for the year 2016).

special commemorative session

an all-day session on 22 july was used to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the international seabed authority. an impressive list of speakers chronicled the transformation of the organisation, from its creation in 1994 to the present.

the president of the assembly, antonio francisco da costa e silva neto (brazil) opened the commemorative session and introduced the secretary-general of the authority, nii a. odunton (ghana) who highlighted some next steps for the authority, including building baseline environmental data and standardizing taxonomies for lesser known fauna and species. the prime minister of host country, jamaica, the most honourable portia simpson miller, welcomed the delegates. a statement from ban ki-moon, secretary-general of the united nations, was delivered by stephen mathias, assistant secretary-general for legal affairs.

the keynote speaker, tommy koh, ambassador-at-large, ministry of foreign affairs, singapore, said the authority must be more visible so that the world may understand its important mission.

initiatives are underway at global, regional and national levels to facilitate the involvement of women in emerging sectors, such as deep-sea marine scientific research (oceanography, geochemistry, geophysics, seismology, and others). however, these efforts, while promising, are not sufficient, and a stronger push is needed. 
the international seabed authority, acutely aware of the great benefits to all of a stronger role for women in marine science, is committed to increase the participation of qualified women, and most particularly those from developing states, in all of its training programmes and other activities. #oceanaction15467

further requests the secretary-general to report to the council at its next session on the status of the extension agreement, including details of the modifications to the plans of work for exploration,
requests further that the applicants be ready to proceed to exploitation at the end of the five-year extension period.
the president then briefly adjourned the meeting to allow the concerned delegations to work together on a new text of the draft decision. a minor amendment was made so that the final wording of paragraph 4 read as follows:
“ further invites the applicants to be ready to proceed to exploitation at the end of the five-year extension period.”
the council then adopted the draft decision to approve the extensions of contracts for exploration of the six contractors.

secretary-general lodge said the work of the commission was highly relevant and extremely important to the work of the authority.
""under the convention, both the commission and the authority have very specific and narrowly defined mandates and responsibilities.""
""these must be carefully understood and respected in order for the overall scheme of the convention to work properly.""
""the commission is tasked to consider data and information submitted by coastal states and to make recommendations in accordance with article 76 relating to the outer limits of the continental shelf. the authority is the organization through which states parties shall organize and control activities in the area""
""the relationship between the area and the continental shelf is complex. whereas the convention defines the maritime zones pertaining to the national jurisdiction of coastal states by reference to objective criteria, such as baselines, or in the case of the continental shelf, by reference to criteria set out in article 76, it defines the extent of the area only by reference to what it is not. thus the area is simply defined as the seabed and subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. its geographical boundaries are still fluid and furthermore they are residual in nature to the maritime zones under national jurisdiction. article 134(4) of the convention, which deals with the scope of part xi, illustrates this point; providing that nothing in that article affects the establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf in accordance with part vi. this means that the only way we can accurately delineate the boundary of the area is by first knowing the limits of national jurisdiction.""
other speakers at the open meeting were mr galo carrera, vice-chairperson of the commission; mr mazlan bin madon, member of the commission; mr walter roest, vice-chairperson of the commission; mr lawrence f. awosika, chairperson of the commission and mr vladimir golitsyn, president of the international tribunal for the law of the sea (itlos).
the commission is a body of 21 experts in the fields of geology, geophysics or hydrography, established in 1997 pursuant to article 2 of annex ii to the united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos). the commission makes recommendations to coastal states on matters related to the establishment of the outer limits of their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.

these critical elements were the strategic plan of the authority, the development of the mining code and the process to develop regional environmental management plans (remps) in the area.
the strategic plan is based on the recommendations contained in the final report of the review committee established under article 154 of unclos where the secretary-general had been requested by the assembly to prepare a draft strategic plan for the authority. following open consultation with stakeholders between 12 march and 27 april 2018, the draft strategic plan has been revised and will be presented to the assembly in july 2018.
""the draft strategic plan is consistent with the mandate of the authority and takes into account developments since 1994, in particular the goals and targets of the 2030 agenda and especially those of sdg14. the draft therefore places particular emphasis on regulatory development, environmental protection and the importance of participation by developing countries.""
on the development of the mining code, mr. lodge said that the council held its first substantive discussion on the draft mining code in march 2018. he continued that immediately following the council, the legal and technical commission met to consider the requests made by the council together with the submissions made by members of the authority and other stakeholders.
""the result is the revised text of the draft exploitation regulations accompanied by a commentary which will be tabled in the six official languages before the commission during the july meetings.""
on the development of remps, mr. lodge recalled that at its meeting in march 2018, the council of the authority had endorsed a preliminary strategy. he mentioned that a scientific workshop was held recently in china in collaboration with china ocean mineral resources research and development association (comra) to explore how to develop remps in the north-pacific, while another would be held in poland, at the end of june 2018, to discuss how to develop remps for polymetallic sulphides deposits on mid-ocean ridges.
he noted that remps were envisaged as the primary vehicle for delivery at the regional level of the authority’s environmental objectives.
""these developments are good illustrations as to how the authority could contribute in the context of the intergovernmental conference on an international legally binding instrument under the united nations convention on the law of the sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction”.
mr. lodge also drew attention to other matters that will be tabled before the council and the assembly during the second part of the 24th annual session which will be held in july 2018.

election of council members
 the council is composed of five groups of states members of the authority, four of which have special interests in aspects of seabed mining. the fifth ensures equitable geographical balance in the council as a whole.
 those elected this afternoon to serve on the 36-member council for the period 2015 to 2018, in accordance with the convention on the law of the sea and assembly decisions, are:
group a:   italy and russian federation (italy would relinquish its seat in group a in favour of the united states if it became a member of the authority; this does not prejudice the position of any country with respect to any intervening election to the council).
group b:   france, germany and republic of korea (germany was re-elected for a period of four years (2015-2018), on the understanding that belgium will occupy the seat in group b for the year 2016).

debate on secretary-general’s report
earlier, the assembly at its morning meeting concluded its debate on the report of the secretary-general, nii allotey odunton (ghana) which reviewed the inter-governmental body’s activities for the past year and its future work programme.
the netherland’s call for a multi-year work plan for the adoption of regulations for exploitation of mineral resources of the deep seabed was echoed by brazil, new zealand, australia, and jamaica. delegations felt that an incremental approach to the important task of formulation those regulations would not be efficient.
regarding overhead charges for the administration and supervision of exploration contracts, brazil suggested an approach to determining reasons why some contractors had not agreed to signing the amended contract.
responding, the secretary-general said the work plan would be developed in collaboration with the legal and technical commission to include the projected number of meetings of the commission and council and the number of workshops to be held. he said the work plan would be completed in time for the 2015 session. on the issue of fees, mr. odunton said that would be a matter for the commission to consider when contract extensions were discussed with contractors.
other matters
under other matters, tonga announced that it would contribute $1,000 to the endowment fund for marine scientific research in the area.
a question related to reporting relationship of the president of the council and the assembly was raised. brazil, in its interpretation of article 162, paragraph 2 (h) of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, felt that a report by the council’s president should be included as an agenda item of the assembly. the representative of the netherlands, supporting brazil, said it would be useful to have such a document for discussion. trinidad and tobago said it shared brazil’s interpretation of the relevant article.
jamaica thanked delegates for their expressions of appreciation towards the host country and its people, and promised to address any issue concerning the facilities which housed the authority’s secretariat.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

deepdata is the only global database designed to organize information related to deep-sea mineral resources and their environment collected by isa exploration contractors during exploration activities. these data and information are systematically collected, standardized, and stored to facilitate data analysis and enhance our collective ability to understand and protect the marine environment in the area.

the five-day workshop held remotely from 21 to 25 september 2020, will bring together over 150 representatives from isa member states, as well as observers, contractors, international and regional organizations, academic institutions, and scientific groups to further develop the functionality of the database, and how the data can be accessed and utilized to benefit humanity as whole.

in his welcome remarks, isa secretary-general mr. michael w. lodge, underlined the importance of the workshop to advancing isa’s mandate under the united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos), particularly as it relates to promoting and encouraging marine scientific research in the area and coordinating the dissemination of the results of this research.

“the launch of deepdata represents a critical achievement,” said the secretary-general. “in designing the database, we have given careful consideration to the different needs of key users, from the legal and technical commission (ltc), to the contractors and the general public,” he added. “these discussions and exchanges will be instrumental to enable the secretariat to progress in its task and ensure that deepdata meets all expectations.”

in her opening remarks, chairperson of the ltc, ms. michelle walker of jamaica, highlighted the need for the secretariat to establish a data management strategy that would optimize the storage of increasingly large volumes of data.

“the central data repository has experienced rapid growth following the increase in the number of exploration contracts, from 10 in 2011 to 30 contracts today,” said ms. walker. “i had the pleasure of joining the launch of deepdata, during the isa 25th session in 2019, where i spoke on its importance to the work of the commission,” she added. “ahead of us are many challenges and opportunities; with our continued collaboration, i am optimistic that deepdata will fulfil its mandate.”

the workshop will be conducted in three parts over the five days including a meeting for ltc members (2 days) from monday, 21 to tuesday, 22 september; a meeting for contractors (2 days) from wednesday, 23 to thursday, 24 september, and an open meeting for the public (1 day) on friday, 25 september.

organized by the international seabed authority (isa), in partnership with the un department of economic and social affairs (undesa), and hosted by the kingdom of tonga, the workshop provided a unique opportunity to discuss further the potential benefits associated with an increased participation of p-sids in deep sea related activities in the international seabed area.
in his opening statement, isa secretary-general mr michael lodge highlighted that the pacific region has been at the forefront when it comes to developing a sustainable deep-sea minerals industry and promoting good governance of marine resources.
“pacific island countries, more than any others, understand very well that it is possible to use marine resources sustainably whilst also fulfilling their responsibilities to the marine environment,” he said. “we need to turn natural capital into human capital, to improve living conditions and to create a better world for future generations.”
mr mahe ‘u.s tupouniua, secretary for foreign affairs, kingdom of tonga added, “the pacific has, and continues to play a leading role in the development of the concept of the blue economy which will contribute to the sustainable development of the region whilst being mindful of needing to conserve and protect the marine environment.”
mr sai navoti, chief, sids unit, undesa highlighted that there are certain capacity characteristics common to p-sids in regards to their quest for deep-sea mining. “these include capacity deficiency on collection and dissemination of geological and mineral resources data and information, and largely untested national laws and policies, along with weak understanding of appropriate environmental framework for deep marine environment, and near total neglect of the social policies necessary for deep-sea mining to ensure adequate and commensurate benefit sharing,” said mr navoti. “the abyssal initiative of isa and undesa aims at addressing some of these capacity gaps,” he added.
mr akuila tawake, deputy director, georesources sector and energy programme at the pacific community (spc) reiterated the role of spc in the region in providing technical advice to members in relation to sustainable of deep-seabed related activities within and beyond national jurisdictions and emphasised the importance of “collective efforts to ensure that pacific island countries and communities will ultimately benefit from any deep sea mining initiative, including the responsible harnessing of deep sea mineral resources within national jurisdiction as well as in “the area.”
held from 12 to 14 february 2019 at the tanoa international hotel, the workshop is part of the joint isa-undesa ‘abyssal initiative for blue growth,’ one of the seven voluntary commitments made by isa at the 2017 un ocean conference to advance implementation of sustainable development goal 14 (sdg 14) to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources (#oceanaction16538).
the workshop focused on the status of deep seabed mining activities in the pacific, the roles and responsibilities of sponsoring states, the legal regime for marine scientific research, and the environmental management of resources. 
panellists included representatives from spc, the pacific island forum secretariat-office of the pacific ocean commissioner (pif-opoc), deep green metals, and tonga offshore mining limited (toml) as well as representatives of the legal and technical commission of isa.

the draft framework for the exploitation regulations contains a preamble which sets out the objectives and overarching principles/purpose of the regulations and ten parts and two annexes:  part i  - introduction and use of terms and scope; part ii - applications for approval of plans of work for exploitation in the form of contracts;  part iii – contracts for exploitation; part iv –protection and preservation of the marine environment; part v –confidentiality; part vi – general  procedures; part vii – enforcement,  offences  and penalties;  viii – settlement of disputes;  part ix –other mineral resource categories and part x –review.
 annex i covers applications for approval of a plan of work for exploitation to obtain a contract, and annex ii deals with standard clauses for exploitation contract plus schedules.
the summary of high level issues include information data; activities in the area; the transition between exploration and exploitation phases; risk assessment, evaluation and management; time limits and costs and confidentiality.  other issues are: effective protection of the environment from harmful effects; adaptive management; “internationally recognized standards” and their significance in exploitation activities; a clear definition of the division of duties and responsibilities of the authority and sponsoring states; and “high-grading” of mineral deposits.
 the rest of the subjects are:  existing best practice, learnings, co-operation and information-sharing; isa-stakeholder consultation; mining inspectorate/ directorate / environmental regulator; an interim framework; and whether there should be one over-arching framework. 
the draft action plan/priority deliverables contains (1) a summary of priority deliverables for the next 12-18 months that the legal and technical commission was to present to the council during its current 21st session and (2) a revised action plan and prioritization, based on stakeholder comments. the commission proposes that further work is performed on the action plan, including target/realistic milestone dates and full costing as its delivery will, inter alia, be dependent on adequate resources being made available. 
the seabed council also took note of a document addressing serious harm to the marine environment in the regulations for the exploitation of mineral resources in the area (isba/21/c/13), submitted by the delegation of the netherlands. it proposed further incorporation of provisions into the exploitation regulations to cover serious harm and threats to the marine environment by activities of contractors in the international seabed area. its representative said the objective was to build upon the legal framework of the united nations convention on the law of the sea and the achievements of the authority to date, including the adoption of the three sets of regulations governing exploration for mineral resources of the area.
also at yesterday's meetings, the council approved plan of work for exploration for  polymetallic nodules submitted by china minmetals corporation.  the corporation, which is sponsored by the people’s republic of china, submitted its application to the secretary-general on 8 august 2014. the region under application covers a surface area of 72,745 km2 within the reserved areas in the clarion-clipperton zone of the pacific ocean. the area consists of eight blocks, which are distributed across the fracture zone.
the council also approved a memorandum of understanding between the authority and the pacific community aimed at promoting the development of regional and national regulatory frameworks that supported the interests of pacific island states and their efforts to regulate and manage activities undertaken under their effective control in the international seabed area. 
the seabed council will reconvene on wednesday (22 july)  as the seabed assembly reconvenes today to hear the report of the secretary-general (21 july).

isa secretary-general mr. michael w. lodge took part in a panel on ‘the blue economy and private sector impact,” moderated by scientific american editor mr. curtis brainard, where he highlighted the unique contribution of isa to advancing the blue economy through ocean science and development of global regulations.

“one of the most significant contributions of isa to the blue economy has been to harness the power of the exploration industry to gather critical scientific knowledge to inform decision-making processes,” said the secretary-general.

“it is through this research that we will be able to identify the best measures required to protect the marine environment,” he added. “over the past 30 years, there have been more than 800 research cruises to the clarion-clipperton zone alone, totaling more than 6,000 days at sea.”

the secretary-general highlighted isa’s second major contribution to the blue economy is the unique legal system developed through isa to manage sustainable development of mineral resources in the international deep seabed area - a truly global regulatory system that applies the highest environmental and operational standards.

“seabed mining is a new industry, but one that promises great benefits for the world, as well as risks need to be managed,” he said. “never before have we had the opportunity to put the regulatory framework in place before a new industry begins, and we are doing this through a collaborative process, with full participation of stakeholders, and with environmental protection at the centre.”

“i hope everyone will join us in these efforts and together deliver a blue economy that is fair to everyone,” he added.

world oceans day was first introduced in 1992 to raise awareness of the crucial role the sea plays as sources of food, oxygen and medicine. it was officially recognized by the un in 2008 and catalysed action worldwide.

the side event, entitled ""enhancing the role of women in deep sea scientific research to achieve the goals and targets of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development by vulnerable countries"" brings to the fore isa's resolve to enhancing the role of women in deep-sea scientific research.
today women account for only 38% of the world’s researchers in ocean science. the rate is even lower for women from developing countries.  
in his opening address, ambassador masud bin momen, permanent representative of bangladesh to the un and chair of the group of ldcs, highlighted several structural challenges faced by women who wish to engage further in the field of marine scientific research. stressing the impact of capacity-building to support structural transformation of ldcs, h.e bin momen also commended the international seabed authority for leading by example. 
michael lodge, secretary-general of the international seabed authority, emphasized the critical importance of the role of women for meeting the goals of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, and how gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls strengthens capacity in technical areas of knowledge, such as deep-sea scientific research. it is in this context that the authority officially announced its voluntary commitment to increase their active participation through targeted capacity-building initiatives at the 2017 un ocean conference. under this initiative, 214 individuals including 86 women have benefited. but, as highlighted by the secretary-general of the authority, this is only the beginning and the authority is determined to ensure this result continues to improve. 
after providing the audience with a presentation on the general challenges commonly faced by female scientists, dr diva amon, a deep-sea biologist from trinidad-and-tobago, underscored the crucial role capacity-building initiatives could play in meeting these challenges. ms. annekah mason highlighted the authority's commitments to gender equality & gender representation through the authority's training programmes in her presentation. 
other notable speakers at the side event included ms. gladys bindura mutangaduro, senior programme officer, high representative for the least developed countries (lldc), landlocked developing countries (ldc) and small island developing states (sids).

mr. michael w. lodge

secretary-general of the international seabed authority

……………………

in his address to the united nations economic and social council in july 2020, the un secretary-general called for a strengthened and renewed multilateralism, geared towards the overarching goals of peace and security, human rights, and sustainable development.

as we celebrate today the achievements of the un, we should recall that one of its greatest and most enduring successes designed to benefit humankind is certainly to be found in the development of a global legal regime for the ocean through the adoption in 1982 of the un convention on the law of the sea. described as the “constitution for the oceans”, this fundamental treaty is indeed a striking illustration of the collective contribution of the international community to this vision of a more fair and equal society.

the 1982 convention established certainty in the law of the sea and brought peace and order to the oceans. it provided for an equitable relationship among states in their use of the ocean and has been a major contribution to international peace and security.

although the convention is multi-faceted, covering every aspect of humanity’s use of the oceans, four key elements stand out: rights of access to the sea and its resources, protection of the marine environment, maritime dispute settlement, and lastly, and obviously most dear to my heart, the convention established an entirely novel legal regime for the largest untapped mineral resources on the planet, designating these resources as the ‘common heritage of mankind.’

these resources are managed by the international seabed authority (isa) which today comprises 167 members and the european union. its unique mandate is to give life to the ideal of equity and economic and social solidarity in the access to and sustainable management of deep seabed minerals for the benefit of all humanity. through isa, access to these resources is assured to both developed and developing states, rich and poor, large, and small. the data collected through exploration and marine scientific research expeditions is compiled with the aim of being shared broadly with all. no other resource on the planet is managed in this way and we have struggled so far to apply similar ideals to extra-terrestrial resources.

at a time when the international community reflects on how to strengthen multilateralism and cooperation, the 75th anniversary of the un presents an inspirational moment to reaffirm our commitment to the un convention on the law of the sea and ensure that its provisions are implemented on the basis of equity and for the benefit of all humanity.

introducing his annual report to the assembly of the authority, mr. odunton said the authority was embarking on the road to commercialization of marine minerals and though there were still major obstacles to be overcome, the goals “are well within reach and are attainable in the foreseeable future”.
one of the challenges was proving that deep-seabed mining was feasible, and could be achieved in an environmentally sustainable manner; another challenge was the adoption of an exploitation code that was transparent and flexible enough to allow for adjustments to its environmental provisions for new information and advances in technology to be incorporated into it. 
article 166, paragraph 4, of the united nations convention on the law of the sea requires the secretary-general to report annually to members of the authority on the work of the authority. details of the report are contained in document isba/22/a/2 and is available at the authority’s website.
the secretary-general announced that the membership of the authority had risen to 168 with the ratification of the united nations convention on the law of the sea by azerbaijan on 16 june 2016. he urged the 19 members who had signed the convention but were yet to become party to the 1994 agreement relating to the implementation of article xi annexed to the convention to do so.  
on the status of members’ contributions, the secretary-general reported that as at 18 july 2016, 44 members of the authority were in arrears for two years or more. he urged these members to settle their arrears promptly.
he thanked members who had made contributions to the funds of the authority: the governments of argentina and the people’s republic of china contributed $10,000 and $40,000 respectively to the voluntary trust fund. since the last session, he said, the institut francais de recherché pour l’exploitation de la mer (ifremer) had contributed $2,777 and mexico $7,500 to the endowment fund for marine scientific research in the area.
the secretary-general highlighted that the agreement for cooperation between the imo and the authority was signed by the imo secretary-general on 8 december 2015 and by him on 8 march 2016. 
with regard to the status of exploration and exploitation in the area, the secretary-general reported that as at 31 may 2016, 24 contracts for exploration had entered into force (15 for polymetallic nodules, 5 for polymetallic sulphides and 4 for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts). 
since the twenty-first session, three new contracts had been signed, he said. on 9 november 2015, a contract for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts with the companhia de pesquisa de recursos minerais was signed in brasilia and on 29 march 2016, a second contract for exploration for polymetallic nodules was signed in new york with uk seabed resources ltd. a contract for exploration for polymetallic nodules with the cook islands investment corporation was signed during this session. it is anticipated that pending contracts with india and with the china minmetals corporation will be signed during 2016.
the secretary-general also announced that the authority had conducted a workshop for the standardization of the procedures and methodologies for taxonomic classification of the fauna in the area. it was convened at the marine biology research group, ghent university, in ghent, belgium, from 14 to 17 december 2015, and was co-hosted by ghent university and global sea mineral resources.

high-level delegates gathered at the event to discuss the joint voluntary commitment made by isa and amdc at the un oceans conference in new york in 2017 (#oceanaction16374), to support africa’s blue economy. 
in his opening statement, isa secretary-general mr. michael lodge highlighted that africa as a regional group, is yet to engage with activities in the seabed area by obtaining exploration contracts from isa, due to the key challenges that need to be overcome by many developing countries.
“the sustainable development of deep seabed minerals could significantly contribute to leveraging the blue economy for all nations, particularly for developing countries but this will require addressing specific challenges in relation to technology, data and information,” said mr. lodge.
“the benefits for african countries of strengthening their engagement in the activities undertaken in the international seabed area cannot be disputed. for this reason, i expect that the implementation of our voluntary commitment will contribute significantly to the regional and national development objectives set out by our member states, especially in the context of the african decade of seas and oceans,” he added.  
the voluntary commitment has been translated into a two-year project, entitled the ‘africa deep-seabed resources project,’ which will be led by isa, and implemented in partnership with the africa union and uneca, in close cooperation with all african states. the government of norway has also recently pledged its support for this project through a grant of $500,000.
in his statement, h.e mr. nikolai astrup, minister of international development, norway highlighted the importance of capacity-building to advance the sustainable development of mineral resources. “it is of vital importance that all states can exercise their rights and fulfill their abilities under the un convention on the law of the sea,” he said. “i hope this initiative will foster new ideas and the blue economy in africa.”
h.e mr. peter thomson, un special envoy for the ocean noted that this is a critical time for the sustainable development of the international seabed area. “the africa deep seabed resources project is exactly the sort of thing we've been calling for,” he said. “congratulations to norway, the international seabed authority and the african mineral development centre for getting it right.” 
in her remarks, ms. vera songwe, executive secretary, of uneca added, “this partnership with the international seabed authority is important for us to enable african states to understand the potential benefits associated with this new industry, as well as ensuring the protection of the marine environment.”
as part of this project, five regional workshops will be held across the african continent. the first was held in abidjan, cote d’ivoire, last month, and received strong representation from african countries, as well as national and international experts, and international organisations.
the outcomes will provide input into the development of regional strategies to help african states fully benefit from their blue economies, particularly regarding increased participation in deep seabed activities.

the new president of the 157-member assembly, nominated by chile on behalf of the group of latin american and caribbean states, is mr mario josé pino of argentina. mr pino is his country’s ambassador to jamaica and permanent representative to the authority.
the assembly also adopted a 13-point agenda, which includes consideration of the annual report of the secretary-general, reports of its finance and credentials committees and examination of the draft regulations on prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.

the assembly president welcomed the three new members of the authority – congo, liberia and swittzerland.  he exhorted members to improve their attendance and participation in the work of the authority and signalled that commitment to the authority’s activities could be beneficial to developing countries in particular.
mr. pino applauded the efforts of the new secretary-general, nii allotey odunton (ghana) in bringing together permanent representatives to the authority to exchange ideas on the work of the organization, especially that of its assembly.  he underscored the significance of the secretary-general’s initiative, which, he said, augured well for better relations between the permanent missions and the secretariat outside of the assembly’s regular sessions.  he also said that permanent missions could play an important role towards increasing participation of delegations at the authority’s meetings.
the assembly approved a request for observer status to the authority from world wildlife fund (wwf international), which has a general consultative status with the united nations economic and social council. the request was annexed to a note by the secretariat (isba/15/a/inf/1) which was added to the agenda. rule 82, paragraph 1 (e) of the rules of procedure of the assembly allows non-governmental organizations to participate in the work of the assembly as observers.
  
wwf international is one of the world’s largest and most experienced independent conservation organizations with a global network active in more than 100 countries. its mission is to stop the degradation of the planet’s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.
the assembly postponed to its next meeting consideration of a similar request from the commonwealth of nations.
in other action, the assembly elected wang quanling (china) to the finance committee to fill the vacancy resulting from the resignation of her compatriot liu jian. ms wang is director, environmental and resources division of the department of economic construction in china’s ministry of finance.
the 36-member council which met soon after the adjournment of the assembly, elected mr mahmoud samy, deputy assistant minister of foreign affairs of egypt, to serve as its president for the authority’s fifteenth session. (a biographical note will be issued as press release sb/15/4).

speaking at the workshop on the draft regulations for the exploitation of mineral resources in the area: policy, legal and institutional considerations in london recently, the international seabed authority's secretary-general, michael lodge mentioned the alternative would have been a first-come, first-served access basis to those mineral resources without international management.  he added that there would be serious risk of conflict between rival claimants and that the financial and economic benefits from these riches would end up in the pockets of the few, and with no single organization having regulatory oversight. 
""thanks to the convention, the financial and economic benefits of this new industry have to be shared for the benefit of mankind as a whole – something that has not been achieved in any other sector.""
mr lodge indicated that the workshop followed a wide-ranging stakeholder process in relation to the development of the draft exploitation regulations and that submissions had been reviewed by the secretariat to identify common themes, as food for thought for the workshop.
""our task now is to operationalize the basic rules set out in the convention, particularly in annex iii, not to overwrite them or to alter the delicate balance between rights and interests that is contained in part xi of the convention. we also need to bear in mind that regulations are primarily intended to govern the relationship between the authority and contractors and to establish the terms of contracts, not to create new legal obligations nor new legal rights on states parties.""
he also added that he would be addressing the issue of regional environmental management plans, which are called for as part of the authority’s overall policy framework for environmental management at the authority's 24th session council meeting next month and which include a series of multi-stakeholder workshops to develop regional environmental management plans, including the identification of areas of particular environmental interest, in areas currently subject to exploration activity. 
""i know that both the council and the general assembly of the united nations have been calling for action on this matter for several years and that is why i have made this one of the priority issues to be addressed in 2018 and beyond. this is an area where the participation of the scientific community will be particularly important, and i look forward to the active engagement and commitment of all stakeholders in this activity. ""
the workshop was hosted by the foreign and commonwealth office and the royal society on 12-13 february in london and discussed key policy issues that need to be addressed in the development of mining regulations during the council sessions in 2018.

there are five outstanding issues for which the secretariat provided additional information. these issues include revisions to regulation 23 (overlapping claims), annex 4, section 17.5 on termination in the event of force majeure, and annex 4, section 25.2 pertaining to enforcement of decisions by competent courts or tribunals. also included is information on the proposed amount of fees for exploration and a formulation that would prevent multiple applications by affiliated applicants in excess of the overall size limitations.
on fees, the paper sets out, in annex 1, elements to be considered in the cost of processing a plan of work for exploration. the paper listed 13 components involved in processing from receipt, custody and acknowledgement of an application, to preparing and updating the contract information in the authority’s database.
the secretariat’s review document suggested possible revisions to relevant provisions of the draft regulations concerning overlapping claims. specifically, it recommended a fifth paragraph in regulation 12 to address the total area covered by the applicant, and regulation 23 with seven paragraphs dealing with overlapping claims as a basis for continued discussion by the council.
according to the revised formulation set out in the document, an overlapping application submitted within a period of 60 days of an earlier application would have the effect of suspending further action on both (or all) applications until such time as any conflicts between applications could be resolved. it also provided options for achieving finality to the process of overlapping claims. such options include binding arbitration in accordance with the united nations commission on international trade law (uncitral), or the optional rules for arbitration of disputes relating to natural resources and /or of the environment.
the document presented by the secretariat also addressed the relevant provisions of section 17 of annex 4 on the standard clauses for exploration contract to include a provision whereby a contract may be considered terminated should an event of force majeure persist for an indefinite period. it noted that since section 21 of annex 4 gives the council powers to suspend or terminate contracts in certain circumstances, and also sets out procedural safeguards for contractors on the receipt of notices of termination or suspension, force majeure would most appropriately be covered in section 21 rather than section 17.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

speaking at a media event in london on thursday, 14 march for the launch of uk seabed resources ltd., the latest exploration contractor with the isa, mr odunton said the increase in interest was a welcome and positive development - driven by the dramatic increase in metal demand, increase in metal prices, decline in the tonnage and grade of land-based nickel, copper and cobalt sulphide deposits and technological advances in deep seabed mining and processing.
he said that in recent years there have been clear signs that the private sector and the financial institutions that support it believe that deep seabed mining can be commercially viable.
he further stated that since the authority became operational in 1996, its primary task has been a painstaking process of rule making designed to ensure that the regulatory regime for exploration is robust, predictable and providing not only for security of tenure for investors but also the necessary protection for the international community as a whole in terms of responsibility for environmental damage.
the international seabed authority has since 2001,  issued 13 licences - with another six in prospect.
full statement
established under the 1982 un convention on the law of the sea, the international community through the international seabed authority administers all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction for the common heritage of mankind, to be developed for the benefit of mankind as a whole.

as part of its mandate, the international seabed authority has been entrusted with the responsibility to ensure the effective protection and preservation of the marine environment, including the impact on biodiversity.  
a critical initiative in that regard was the adoption by the council of the authority in 2012, following an extensive consultative process, of the first-ever environmental management plan for the area in the clarion-clipperton zone. the process included the designation of a network of nine areas of particular environment interest through a collaborative process involving numerous relevant stakeholders. recently, in march 2018, the council welcomed the announcement of further efforts for the development of regional environmental management plans under the auspices of the authority.  these plans will be developed for key provinces where exploration activities under contract are carried out. to this end, through a series of workshops in the course of 2018-2020, the authority will bring together scientific experts, representatives of member states, sponsoring states, contractors, academia and non-governmental organizations, who will identify knowledge gaps and formulate recommendations.   
to get the process underway immediately, two workshops will be organised soon, one in partnership with the chinese ocean mineral resources research and development association, in china (may 2018) and another one in poland (june 2018). 
the authority is actively pursuing other critical initiatives to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. one in particular relates to the publication of online deep-sea taxonomic atlases that will be accessible freely by all (#oceanaction17776). another one deals with the development of long-term monitoring for the deep-ocean to increase knowledge of deep-sea biodiversity and ecological processes and functions including the impacts of climate change on deep-sea ecosystems (#oceanaction17746).

background

during its meetings in february 2020, the council requested the secretariat to prepare a comparative study of seabed mining and land-based mining before the next meeting of the open-ended working group of the council in respect of the development and negotiation of the financial terms of a contract (oewg),[1] expected to be held prior to the meetings of the council during the second part of the twenty-sixth session.

the study will focus on the financial aspects and include the identification of:

(a)  the royalty rates;

(b)  the taxable base in those jurisdictions representing the bulk of production for the same or similar minerals and/or ores, e.g., manganese, copper, cobalt and nickel;

(c) any environmental levies; and

(d) any administrative fees.

the study will identify the average royalty rate(s) and methodology to determine a taxable base that would neither advantage nor disadvantage the contractors of the authority in relation to land-based producers.

the study will also consider the corporate income tax regimes of major land-based producer jurisdictions and draw a comparison with those of sponsoring states and other states that would be involved in the entire value chain of contractors of the authority.

modalities of preparation of the study

two consultants have been contracted by the secretariat, namely, rmg consulting and cru international ltd., to prepare the study.

with a view to ensuring that the study provides a solid basis for further discussions, the secretariat will organize a series of informal interactive webinars.

the objective of the webinars is to enable stakeholders to understand better the methodology being applied by the consultants for the study and for the consultants to understand the concerns and positions of stakeholders with respect to the study and its methodology, with a view to presenting a report that commands broad support within the council.

the webinars will be structured to: 1) enable the consultants to present participants with information on the methodology to be followed in the preparation of the study; and 2) receive any related feedback from stakeholders.

while interactive, the webinars are convened for information purposes and are not intended as a forum for negotiations; the informal negotiating process occurring within the oewg. nor are the webinars intended to constitute a stakeholder consultation.

modalities of the webinars

three webinars, of one to two hours each, will take place during the second week of june 2020 as follows:


			8 june (11am – 12:30pm)

speaking at the oceans and the law of the sea agenda item 76(a) at the un general assembly's 66th session, secretary-general odunton told the assembly that following the approval by the authority's council of the two applications, the isa and comra signed the first every 15-year exploration contract in beijing on 18 november 2011.  he said the contract with the russian federation was being finalised and would be signed in due course.
he said another first for the authority was the approval of two applications by private sector interests, sponsored by developing states, for plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules in the so-called reserved areas by nauru ocean resources inc., sponsored by the republic of nauru and by tonga offshore mining ltd., sponsored by the kingdom of tonga.
he said not only were these the first applications for exploration licences in the international area by genuine private-sector entities, but they were the first applications to have been made for reserved areas, on the basis of sponsorship by developing states.
secretary-general odunton told the assembly that the original purpose behind the parallel system of exploitation as set out in the convention was to provide developing states with a practical and realistic means of participating in seabed mining, either in their own right or through the enterprise.
the effect of the 1994 agreement was to delay, perhaps indefinitely, the establishment of the enterprise, leaving developing states with few options to actively participate in seabed mining given the huge financial risks involved. the only realistic option for most developing states therefore was to form partnerships with commercial interests that have access to the financial capital and technology necessary to conduct deep sea exploration.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

the main purpose of this high-level event was to present the key components of the draft action plan by highlighting how it represents the objectives identified for the un decade and the six strategic research priorities around which isa will mobilize its actions in a complementary and synergistic manner.

in his opening remarks, the isa secretary-general mr. michael w. lodge recalled that “the draft action plan reflects the ongoing support of isa towards the objectives of the un decade of ocean science. our commitment to the decade comes directly from the specific and unique mandate given to isa by the un convention on the law of the sea as it relates to marine scientific research in the area”.

the permanent representative of france to isa and president of the 26th assembly, h.e denys wibeaux, emphasized that “the action plan that the assembly is invited to consider for adoption is not only in the continuity of what has been agreed by the members, through the strategic plan and the high-level action plan for 2019-2023, but more importantly reflects accurately what the authority is about. first, advancing science and knowledge to ensure the sustainable development of seabed minerals activities in the area and second, ensuring that this is done for the benefit of humankind.”

the webinar was structured around four main panels and brought together senior representatives of members of isa, heads and high-level officials of international and regional organizations and the scientific community. each panel provided the opportunity to emphasize the importance of marine scientific research and deep-sea research as fundamental elements to achieve the responsible management of the oceans and their resources.

“as champion of the draft action plan, argentina will work together with isa to promote the shared goals of the un decade of ocean science to foster global actions to advance ocean sciences for the benefit of humankind,” declared the permanent representative of argentina to isa, h.e luis del solar dorrego.

mr ariel troisi, chair of ioc-unesco, stressed that “the un decade aims at proposing a change of tack in the generation of ocean knowledge through transformative ocean science solutions for sustainable development.”

following, dr vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of ioc-unesco congratulated isa for the draft action plan and underlined the ongoing and positive cooperation between the organizations, formalized with the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2001.

opening the discussion on the importance of advancing scientific knowledge of the deep-sea for the sustainable development of the ocean resources including the understanding of biodiversity and ecosystems functions, the minister of oceans and fisheries of the republic of korea, dr. seong-hyeok moon stressed the fruitful and ongoing collaboration between isa and korea as reflected in several initiatives such as the organization of a taxonomic standardization workshop and further advances in the development of a regional environmental management plan for the northwest pacific. “it is my belief that isa has a critical role to play for the sustainable development of deep-sea minerals resources and there is no doubt that through this action plan, isa will guide the international community to better achieve what the un decade ocean envisions,” he added.

acknowledging isa’s efforts to deepen scientific knowledge and understanding of deep-sea ecosystems in the area, mrs. veronika veits director of the dg mare of the european commission also underscored “the need to understand better the effects and risks of seabed exploitation on the deep-sea ecosystems and whether practices and technologies are safe, and this before we start these activities.” she then added that in light of this, “the draft action plan of isa in support of the un decade of ocean science was therefore highly welcome.”

placing the emphasis on the need to strengthen deep-sea scientific capacity of developing states, h.e fekita ‘utoikamanu, usg un-ohrlls underlined that “within the framework of unclos and through isa we can and we must foster a greater cooperation to enhance opportunities for the most vulnerable countries”.

“as deep-sea mining continues to grow as an industry, we must ensure that also developing states can benefit from such operations. this is especially salient regarding deep-sea mining in the area, as the mineral resources there are common heritage of mankind, and thus belong to us all. this is why capacity building needs to be central to our collective agenda,” said ms. marte ziolkowski, state secretary at the ministry of foreign affairs of norway. “the authority is important as a provider of and facilitator for competence development and transfer of technology to developing states. in discussions on developing cooperation, the authority is frequently mentioned as an example of how capacity building should be conducted,” she added.

h.e rabab fatima, permanent representative of bangladesh to isa and to the un stressed that “isa has a central role to play in facilitating multi-stakeholder strategic partnerships at the subregional, regional, and global level to advance marine scientific research in the deep-sea, particularly for less technology advanced states.”

in closing the webinar, h.e liu zhenmin, usg undesa commended isa for presenting a “very comprehensive plan”. he then added that “all nations need scientific solutions to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. therefore, creating enabling conditions to build the capabilities and the capacities of developing states and facilitate the technologies transfer will be key to ensure that all can benefit from the blue economy. these important elements embody the vision of isa action plan.”

the live high-level event took place on the margins of the work of the 26th session of the assembly of isa which is progressing its work through silence procedure.

also this morning, the council took note of the report of the secretary-general, nii  allotey odunton (ghana), concerning the credentials of members of the council. in other matters, the council continued discussions on guidelines and procedures it would recommend to its expert body, the legal and technical commission, for the extension of  contracts for exploration of minerals in the area by investors whose contracts are due to expire in the next few years.
three plans of work were approved for exploration for polymetallic nodules to be carried out by united kingdom seabed resources ltd , ocean mineral singapore pte ltd, and the cook islands investment corporation. the report and recommendations of the legal and technical commission for these three applicants are contained in documents isba/20/c/5; isba/20/c/7, and isba/20/c/18 respectively.
two applications, from the government of india (isba/20/c/6) and the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources of germany (bgr) (isba/20/c/16) were approved for exploration for polymetallic sulphides.  the remaining two applications were submitted for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts by the ministry of natural resources and environment of the russian federation (isba/20/c/4) and companhia de pesquisa de recursos minerais, a brazilian entity (isba/20/c/17).
the procedure for consideration by the legal and technical commission of applications for plans of work for exploration in the area are identical in the regulations covering each mineral. in considering a proposed plan of work for exploration, the commission is required to take into account the principles, policies and objectives relating to activities in the area as provided for in part xi and annex iii of the united nations convention on the law of the sea and the 1994 agreement on the implementation of part xi (seabed mining provisions) of the convention.
discussion
nigeria cautioned about the fact that some of the applicants already had existing contracts but their level of performance or capability had not yet been assessed by the authority.
with regard to the application of the ocean mineral singapore pte ltd, argentina noted with concern that the commission’s report did not identify the name of the affiliate which may enter into a management services agreement with the applicant.  the representative was of the view that such information should be specified in the application. chile endorsed the position.
germany pointed out that the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources had made amendments to its original application which modified the area under application. those amendments were needed because its application area overlapped with that applied for by the government of india. the representative said that such problems were likely to occur again because prospective applicants had no knowledge of the areas requested by others.  the representative suggested that the commission could look into ways to rectify them. the comment drew support from france and the united kingdom.
a number of delegations expressed satisfaction with the progress made by the approval of the seven new plans of work in the area.  fiji and jamaica noted that several developing countries would be among the new contractors as was envisioned in article 148 of the  convention. senegal noted that the “grand dream” of converting the resources of the ocean into the wealth of mankind was closer to becoming a reality.  cameroon said the progress confirmed the wisdom and foresight of those who “tirelessly worked to craft and adopt the convention.”
representatives of the seven prospective contractors expressed appreciation to the council and the commission and affirmed their commitment to fulfil their obligations to the authority.  russia said included in its plans were guidelines to ensure effective preservation of the marine environment and a training programme.  the united kingdom said it took great care in reviewing the work plan of uk seabed resources limited, applying the highest standards of environmental protection.  the representative of singapore said that his country had a sound reputation of good governance and was in the process of developing robust legislation to govern deep seabed activities.
proposal on extension of exploratory contracts
the delegation of brazil submitted a proposal to the council on guidelines and procedures for the implementation of regulations relating to the extension of plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules in the seabed area.
the  document states that  in the interest of fairness, the council might wish to authorise a provisional extension  of up to six months to those contracts that expire in 2016 to allow contractors to prepare their submissions for extension, if they so wish.
in the event that an exploitation code was not available by the time a contractor attested to its willingness and capacity to proceed to the exploitation stage, as confirmed by the legal and technical commission, the document says the contract in question would be awarded a provisional extension of no more than two years, as specified in article 15 (b) of section 1 of the annex to the 1994 agreement.
noting that any request for extension was not an automatic renewal of an existing contract of exploration, but rather “akin to a new application that should be conducive to a contract of exploitation”, brazil’s document states that the following procedures should apply:

the proposal should be preceded by a detailed explanation by the contractor of the reasons why an extension is requested and the length of time required, to a maximum of five years;


the proposal should take the form of an application that outlines the work  that would be undertaken to enable the contractor to proceed to the exploitation stage, including a detailed plan of work for each year of extension;


the proposal should also highlight what changes in the terms and conditions of the existing contract the contractor wishes to make;


the sponsoring state must extend the certificate of sponsorship for the period of extension requested;


the payment of a fee that covers the costs incurred by the authority in assessing the proposal, as well as an annual overhead charge to cover the costs of supervision; the amount of such fee and overhead charge should be determined by the finance committee and presented to the council  at its 2015 session. 

the brazil document earlier notes that the council might wish to provide the secretary-general and the legal and technical commission with general guidance on the basis of the following elements – taking into account views expressed during the debate on the subject – either by adopting it or by an understanding to be provided in a report of its chairman.
the document states that the commission should consider the following general principles and standards for the preparation of draft procedures and criteria for applicants for extensions of contracts for exploration:

the pertinent principles governing the area, as contained in part xi, section 2 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, in particular those contained in  articles 139 (responsibility to ensure compliance and liability for damage), 143 (marine scientific research), 145 (protection of the marine environment), 146 (protection of human life) and 148 (participation of developing states in the activities in the area) of the convention;


article 153 (system of exploration and exploitation) of the convention, in particular its paragraphs 4,5 and 6;


article 189 (limitation of jurisdiction with regard to decisions of the authority) of the convention;


article 300 (good faith and abuse of rights) of the convention.

according to brazil’s document, the periodic reviews of implementation of each plan of work should have provided for an evaluation, over the first ten years of each individual contract, of the implementation of the plan of work and of the stage in which each contractor was in terms of the necessary preparatory work for proceeding to the exploitation stage, as well as provided for any adjustment related to any circumstances confronted by each contractor, including those beyond its control.
as regards the interpretation of the prevailing economic circumstances that might not justify proceeding to the exploitation stage, the document observes that it is hard not to agree with the secretariat that ‘if after 15 years a particular contractor’s project is not viable for reasons that are unconnected to global economic conditions, it seems difficult to understand why an extension for a further five years is justified’.
the document adds that it is worth considering only what criteria should be applied to judge the economic feasibility of each individual contract to proceed to the exploitation phase in no more than five years. it observes that the extension of each individual contract may require the revision of its terms and conditions as the authority and the contractor may agree in accordance with the regulations, as provided for under section 3.2 of the standard clauses.
at this afternoon’s meeting, the council will discuss the issues relating to the extension of exploration contracts in light of the proposal put forward by brazil.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

speaking at pew charitable trusts in washington, on tuesday 13 november 2017, isa secretary-general michael lodge paid tribute to the very constructive engagement between pew and the authority. 
he recalled that the authority represents a unique experiment in international relations and that for many states, it fulfills a long held vision that the mineral wealth of the deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction should not be appropriated by a few technologically advanced countries but shared between all countries including landlocked and disadvantaged countries as the common heritage of mankind.
“the task of the authority is to deliver on this vision and to make sure that it is done in the most responsible and sustainable way possible.""
mr lodge also highlighted two major challenges for the authority as being : 
putting in place a workable regulatory framework that incentivizes contractors to commit significant investment and resources to develop exploitation projects while also addressing concerns of state parties to the convention, as well as other stakeholders, including environmental groups; and 
the second major challenge was environmental planning at the regional scale. beyond the clarion clipperton zone environmental management plan, the urgent need to develop regional plans in mineral provinces where exploration activities are taking place was recognized by both the isa council and the general assembly of the united nations.  key areas that have been identified include the mid-atlantic ocean ridge, the indian ocean triple junction ridge and the northwest pacific.
mr lodge said he believed that the isa had a unique opportunity to provide the best available political platform to establish a comprehensive framework for environmental management and hoped that others would find this vision equally compelling and join the isa in this enterprise.

opening the morning session, president of the assembly mr. milan j. n. meetarbhan (mauritius), said the landmark convention allowed the world to celebrate a treaty addressing the concept of the common heritage of mankind, and the establishment of its appurtenant legal regime and implementing agency.  he described article 136 of the convention as “one of the landmarks of legal drafting of international instruments by virtue of its simplicity, yet unambiguous affirmation of a commitment to international cooperation and equity”
prime minister of host country jamaica, the most honourable portia simpson miller, said the thirtieth anniversary commemoration held special significance for her government and people who are celebrating fifty years of nationhood this year. “we are humbled by the fact that just over a decade after gaining independence, jamaica was able to play an active role in helping to craft this landmark legislation”, the prime minister said.
mrs. simpson miller highlighted some contributions of the convention to global political and economic development such as improved international maritime law and the avoidance of disputes, and scientific research. she said the emphasis on the protection and preservation of the marine environment and its resources is of major importance to jamaica and the caribbean which rely on the ocean’s resources for tourism, fishing and transportation.
in his address, secretary-general nii allotey odunton (ghana) reflected on the authority’s significant achievements since it was launched thirty years ago on 10 december 1982. he recalled the skepticism deep sea mining attracted during its infancy in the 1960s and the years of negotiations it took before the authority was established on 16 november 1994 with headquarters in kingston, jamaica.
the secretary-general said the authority has endured teething pains and “evolved into a  substantive organization with the current 162 parties to the convention.” he noted that isa has adopted two sets of regulations on prospecting and exploration for polymetallic nodules (in 2000) and for polymetallic sulphides (in 2010) in the area, and is on the verge of adopting a third set of regulations on cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.

for the first time, the report is comprised of two documents - an official document of the assembly that  reports on the status of unclos and related legal instruments; the status of contributions to the budget of the isa and the status of the area - along with a new report entitled ‘achieving the sustainable use of deep-sea minerals for the benefit of humankind.’

the report is organized around the nine strategic directions set out in the isa strategic plan for the period 2019-2023 adopted by the assembly in 2018, highlighting the important progress made to advance the mandate of isa in regards to promoting deep-sea marine scientific research; protecting the marine environment from potential impacts of deep seabed mining and building the capacity of developing states members to benefit from the mineral wealth of the seabed. the report also places an emphasis on the strategic partnerships through which isa operates.

“in a year that has presented unexpected challenges for all of us, i wish to express my appreciation to all the members of isa for their continued support in our work,” said mr. lodge.

“i am confident that the new and improved format will provide a great opportunity to shine a light on all the remarkable achievements that were possible because of our collective work,” he added. “i also express my sincere thanks to the secretariat staff, without whom none of the activities described in this report could have taken place.”

the report shows that notwithstanding the significant achievements made over the last year, there is still much more work to be done at the request of isa members in the areas of capacity development, taxonomy standardization, and the sharing of information and knowledge building.

the report also notes the crucial need to continue collective efforts to finalize a robust, regulatory framework for the development of the mineral resources of the area, in line with the provisions of unclos.

knowledge in science, technology and innovation is essential for the achievement of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, particularly sustainable development goal 14 (sdg14), as well as for promoting social innovation, and ultimately, benefiting society at large. yet, the deep seabed remains one of the last frontiers where knowledge and understanding by the public is lacking across virtually all disciplines. in the context of its strategic plan and high-level action plan adopted for the period 2019-2023, isa has committed to address these challenges through increased public outreach.

in 2017, the un general assembly declared the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development for 2021-2030 to foster scientific research and technological innovation in support of a healthier, more sustainable ocean. the objectives of the ocean decade are at the core of isa’s mandate, which is to promote and encourage the conduct of marine scientific research in the ara, whilst ensuring that the results of the research are disseminated widely.

a dedicated action plan for increasing public deep-sea literacy and understanding of the legal framework for activities undertaken in the area would help address these challenges and opportunities, with a strong focus on developing outreach products and building partnerships to advance deep-sea literacy. 

interested candidates with the requisite experience in marine policy, international law, ocean science or related fields should submit their proposals, in line with the terms of reference which can be found here: https://bit.ly/32cicml to eosg@isa.org.jm by 25 september 2020.

the two-day workshop held remotely from 15 to 16 september, brings together 130 representatives from isa members, as well as observers, contractors, international organizations and initiatives, academic institutions, natural history museums, and scientific groups. 

in his welcome remarks, isa secretary-general mr. michael w. lodge, underlined the significant  contribution of the workshop to advancing isa’s mandate under the united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos), particularly as it relates to its central role in protecting the marine environment from the potential harmful effects that may arise from activities in the international seabed area, “the area.”

“the workshop will assist isa to fulfil its duty to promote and encourage marine scientific research in the area and disseminate the results to all,” said mr. lodge. “i expect the outputs will inform the work of the secretariat in initiating concrete actions with a view to establishing a global platform for collaboration, through which we will be able, together with all of  partners, to support and contribute to the effective generation, use, and sharing of deep-sea taxonomic information.”

in his opening remarks, the deputy minister of oceans and fisheries, mr. woon-yul oh, highlighted the important contribution made by the republic of korea to the work of isa as a sponsoring state.

“as daunting as it may be to study further into the deep-sea, it is a task which makes it all the more important for researchers worldwide to work closely with one another,” said the minister. “in this context, i find this workshop very meaningful in that it will serve as a forum for us to discuss and chart out paths forward, including joint research and knowledge sharing platforms, to build and enhance global capacity for deep-sea taxonomy research.”

over the two days, participants will discuss ways to advance taxonomic knowledge of deep-sea biological communities, including tools for targeting different types of uses and users;  identify existing institutions and resources that can provide taxonomic services and training on taxonomic skills, and explore mechanisms for collaboration among contractors, academic and scientific institutions, and other stakeholders.

executive council, drafting of marine minerals mining
code and consideration of applications for seabed
exploration contracts

the jamaica-based international seabed authority will commemorate its twentieth anniversary, elect nearly half its executive council and begin elaboration of a mining code for deep seabed polymetallic nodules in the area beyond national jurisdiction when it convenes for its annual session in kingston from 14 to 25 july 2014.

the development of the exploitation regulations has become urgent as the exploration contracts of the seven pioneer investors expire between march 2016 and march 2017. the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea and the 1994 agreement relating to the implementation of the convention’s part xi (seabed provisions) provide that the contractors must either apply for a plan of work for exploitation or seek an extension of their exploration contract. it is possible that some might apply for mining contracts. a key task for the authority is the development of the mining regulations, including their financial terms.

the special day-long commemorative session will take place on tuesday, 22 july although the twentieth anniversary itself falls on 16 november. the authority was established upon the entry into force on 16 november 1994 of the convention. the convention was opened for signature on 10 december 1982 at montego bay, jamaica.

the authority, now with a membership of 166 (including the european union), will formally begin its session on 15 july. among the issues on its agenda are seven pending applications for exploration contracts in the seabed area; the authority’s 2015-2016 budget; election of 17 states parties to the 36-member council for the period 2015 to 2018; and the annual report of the authority’s secretary-general, nii allotey odunton (ghana), which reviews its accomplishments and future activities and programmes.

the authority is responsible for all mineral-related activities in the deep seabed area beyond national jurisdiction. its main tasks, as outlined in the convention and the agreement, include administering the mineral resources of the area, the promotion and encouragement of marine scientific research in the area, and ensuring the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects arising from exploration and future exploitation. the authority also organizes workshops on various aspects of seabed exploration and exploitation and disseminates information resulting from them.

seven workshops are to be convened by the authority during 2014-2016. they will include the classification of polymetallic nodule resources in exploration areas, standardization of the taxonomies of macrofauna and meiofauna associated with polymetallic nodules in contract areas in support of contract administration; exploration and exploitation technologies for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, as well as on polymetallic sulphides. a workshop on megafauna associated with polymetallic nodules was held in germany last year.

one of the workshops will be on article 82 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea which requires state parties to make payments or contributions in kind for exploitation of the non-living resources of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. the other will cover the environmental management plan for the clarion-clipperton zone in the pacific ocean.

on 27 january 2014, the authority signed the first contract for exploration for cobalt-rich crusts with japan oil, gas and metals national corporation (jogmec). a contract for exploration for cobalt-rich crusts was also signed with china ocean mineral resources research and development association (comra) in beijing, china on 29 april 2014.  a contract for exploration for polymetallic sulphides with the government of the republic of korea was signed on 15 june 2014 at seoul and on 24 june 2014 at kingston. that brings the number of exploration contracts issued by the international seabed authority to 17.

legal and technical commission

one of the most important substantive matters before the twentieth session is the seven pending applications for exploration contracts in the seabed area which is being considered by the legal and technical commission.

during its february 2014 session, the legal and technical commission considered applications submitted by the ministry of natural resources and environment of the russian federation for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts; by uk seabed resources ltd. for exploration for polymetallic nodules; by the government of india for exploration for polymetallic sulphides; and by ocean minerals singapore pty ltd. for exploration for polymetallic nodules. these were deferred from the nineteenth session in 2013.

before the commission are three new applications submitted in december 2013 by the following entities: the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources of germany (bgr) for approval of  a plan of work for exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the central indian ocean; the cook islands investment corporation (ciic), sponsored by the cook islands, for approval of a plan of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules in a reserved area in the clarion-clipperton fracture zone of the pacific ocean ; and the companhia de pesquisa de recursos minerais s.a. (cprm), sponsored by brazil, for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the rio grande rise.

the commission’s recommendations on these new applications will be submitted to the council during the twentieth session. if all seven pending applications are approved, the authority will have 26 exploration contracts in force.

on the polymetallic nodules exploitation code, the commission has been requested by the council to establish an appropriate fiscal framework that is fair for the industry, investors and the authority’s member states, who are intended to be beneficiaries of seabed mining. it started work on the legal instrument at its february session. the commission is reported to have considered a study commissioned by the secretariat concerning different policy and financial objectives relating to a fiscal regime, comparable mining regimes and fiscal rates of payments and calculation methodologies and current best practices. 

following the commission’s february session, the secretariat launched a stakeholder survey in march 2014 to solicit information from the authority’s members as well as all other stakeholders for the development of a regulatory framework for the exploitation of deep sea minerals. the responses received will be made available on the authority’s website. the commission will submit a progress report to the council.    

 the commission will consider matters referred to it by the council, including proposed amendments to regulation 21 of the regulations on prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the area; issues of monopolization of activities in the area; conflict of interest; and issues relating to the operation of the future enterprise, the mining arm of the authority, particularly the legal, technical and financial implications for the authority.

furthermore, the commission will consider the implementation of training programmes of exploration contractors as well as allocation of training opportunities.

the contractors have a legal obligation to provide and fund those programmes for personnel from developing countries and the authority.

the commission will also review the annual reports of contractors, the implementation of the environmental management plan for the clarion-clipperton zone as well as information on data management.
 council
 
following the election of its officers for the session, the council, which oversees the implementation of the provisions of the convention and the agreement, will fill vacancies on the legal and technical commission. brazil, argentina and jamaica have nominated candidates to complete the terms of their nationals who have resigned.

the council will consider a report on the work of the commission during its february and july sessions and take up any matters referred to it, including recommendations on new applications for approval of plans of work for exploration in the area. it will also act on recommendations on proposed revisions to regulation 21 of the regulations on the prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the area (isba/16/a/12/rev.1).  
 
the council will also consider a report and recommendations of the finance committee on a number of financial matters, including the proposed budget of the authority for the financial period 2015-2016 and the scale of assessment for contributions to it.

it is the turn of the african group to nominate a president of the council for the session.

finance committee

 the finance committee, at its meetings before the authority’s session, will review the implementation of the authority’s budget for 2013-2014 and cost-saving measures undertaken by the secretariat. the committee will also examine the secretary-general’s proposed budget for the financial period 2015-2016 estimated at $8,616,770 and $8,304,345, respectively.

according to the secretariat, as of 30 april, 68.7 per cent of the value of contributions to the 2014 budget due from the authority’s members had been received. as at the same date, 43 members were in arrears of contributions for a period of two years or more.   

other matters on the committee’s agenda include an audit report on the accounts of the authority, a report on the proposed museum for the authority and a report on the status of the voluntary trust fund, the international seabed authority endowment fund and the working capital fund.     
 voluntary trust fund

 the voluntary trust fund for the participation of developing country members of the finance committee and the legal and technical commission was established in 2002.

since then, contributions totalling us$ 443,699 have been paid into the fund. the last contribution of us$ 44,760 was made in september 2013 by japan. the total amount paid out of the fund as of 30 april 2014 is us$ 491,570. the balance now stands at us$ 154,038.

endowment fund

the endowment fund for marine scientific research in the area, established in 2006, promotes and encourages the conduct of collaborative marine scientific research in the international seabed area. it carries these out by supporting the participation in the research of qualified scientists and technical personnel from developing countries.

as at 30 april 2014, the capital of the fund stood at us$ 3,417,038, with a total of us$ 428,932 being disbursed, in the form of awards, from the interest accrued on the capital.    

a total of 56 scientists or government officials from developing countries have benefited from financial support from the endowment fund. an advisory panel evaluates applications and makes recommendations to the authority’s secretary-general,

the authority’s secretariat maintains a network of institutions which provides opportunities for scientific collaboration, including research cruises, deep sea sample analysis, training and internship programmes. 
  international seabed authority museum

 a proposal will be submitted to the finance committee for the establishment of the international seabed authority museum during the 2015 to 2016 biennium. the museum, to be constructed on the ground floor of the headquarters premises, is to cover an area of 6,344 square feet. the estimated cost of construction is $500,000, while its annual maintenance cost is estimated at $150,000.

exhibits for the museum will be requested from contractors and other sources. it is expected that the museum will be open to the general public during intersessional periods.

assembly

 the assembly, the authority’s supreme body, in which all members are represented, is expected to elect, as its president, antonio francisco da costa e silva neto, permanent representative of brazil to the international seabed authority. it is the turn of the group of latin american and caribbean states to nominate a candidate for the position. other regional groups can nominate a vice-president of the assembly.

 the assembly’s agenda items include consideration of the annual report of the secretary-general, adoption of the authority’s budget and the scale of assessment for contributions to it, and elections to fill vacancies on the council.

the terms of office of 17 council members will end on 31 december 2014 in accordance with the convention and the decisions of the assembly. the election of their replacements will be based on a formula designed to ensure equitable representation of countries from various regional groups. these include the largest consumers or net importers of minerals to be derived from seabed mining; those with the largest investment in seabed mineral exploration; and the land-based exporters of minerals found on the seabed. council members serve for four years.

the three successful applicants are mr. girish beedessee (mauritius), mr. srinivas rao (india) and mr. sabyasachi sautya of india.
mr. girish beedessee is currently working at the mauritius oceanography institute (moi) under the supervision of dr. daniel marie. the title of his project is “biological activities and properties of extracts derived from invertebrates and microbial communities of hydrothermal vent faunas at the central indian ridge”. he will work with dr. ken takai of jamstec, japan.
fascinated by the abundance and diversity of organisms found at hydrothermal vents, and with the possibility of finding novel genes, proteins and molecules which can contribute to interesting biological properties, mr. beedessee says the fellowship would provide him with an opportunity to look at the biological properties of invertebrates and microbial symbionts sampled at vent systems of the central indian ridge (cir).
mr. srinivas rao completed his m.sc. in physical oceanography from andhra university in 2007 and joined as a research scholar under the ridge project at the national institute of oceanography (nio), goa, india to pursue a ph.d. in oceanography, under the guidance of dr. p. vethamony and dr. k.a. kamesh raju of nio.  as a part of his work in nio he has been working on physical properties of the water column over the indian ocean ridge systems. he has also participated in cruises exploring the carlsberg ridge and central indian ridge systems to acquire physical oceanography data using ctd, mapr’s and auv.
mr. srinivas rao’s proposal is entitled “distribution of hydrothermal sources over the slow spreading indian mid oceanic ridges”, and he will be collaborating with dr. edward t. baker  of the pacific marine environmental laboratory, noaa, usa.  mr.  rao said the interridge/isa fellowship would give him an opportunity to learn about the processing and interpretation of deep-sea physical oceanography data in relation to hydrothermal plumes/vents and analysing the water column data (with ctd and mapr) collected during several cruises under the indian ridge programme.
mr. sabyasachi sautya also studies in the biological oceanography division at nio, under the supervision of dr. baban ingole. his proposal title is “exploration of the megabenthic assemblages of the carlsberg ridge, indian ocean”. the carlsberg ridge is a large seabed mountain range in the indian ocean, generally rocky with some sediment cover. recent research has identified possible evidence of vent-derived plumes.
although little information is available on hard-substratum communities in the deep ocean, particularly in the indian ocean, extensive underwater video has been collected from the ridge, which will allow assessment, for the first time, of the variation in the rocky habitats and their biological communities, as well as potential evidence for hydrothermal processes allowing the linking of biological and geological patterns and assessing ecosystem function on the carlsberg ridge.
the interridge student and postdoctoral fellowship programme continues to develop and reach out to the global community of young ocean scientists. in the past three years a successful partnership has been established between interridge and the isa endowment fund, designed to support early career scientists from developing countries in collaborative marine scientific research.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

in accordance with previous decisions of the assembly, the terms of office of the 19 members of the council ended on 31 december 2020. the election to fill the vacancies was held through a silence procedure during the 26th session of the assembly, which was carried over to 2021 due to the pandemic of covid-19.

as per the decision of the isa assembly, the following states have been elected to the council for a period of four years as from 1 january 2021 to 31 december 2024: china and japan in group a;  india in group b; canada and south africa in group c; bangladesh, brazil and uganda for group d; argentina, costa rica, czech republic, mauritius, morocco, the netherlands (subject to rotation arrangement with belgium and norway), poland, sierra leone (subject to rotation arrangement with algeria), spain (subject to rotation arrangement with norway), trinidad and tobago, and the united kingdom (subject to rotation arrangement with norway) in group e.

“i am very pleased to see the diversity of representation on the council and particularly pleased that in these difficult times member states were able to achieve an election by consensus”, said isa secretary-general mr. michael w. lodge.

the council consists of 36 members of isa elected by the assembly in five different regional groups of countries. as “the executive organ of isa”, the council establishes specific policies in conformity with the convention and the general policies set by the assembly. it supervises and coordinates implementation of the regime established by the convention to promote and regulate exploration for and exploitation of deep-sea minerals by states, corporations and other entities. under this system, no such activity may legally take place until contracts have been signed between each interested entity and isa. the council’s task is to adopt the rules, regulations and procedures of the authority (pending approval by the assembly), approve applications for exploration or exploitation contracts, oversee implementation of the contracts, and establish environmental and other standards.

“technological advancements and the rising price of minerals have created favourable economic conditions for seabed mining,” said mr. satya nandan, secretary-general of the international seabed authority (isa). “at the same time, we have a greater understanding of the environment in which these resources occur – and how to prevent undue harm to it when we’re ready to undertake mining activities.”
deep-seabed mining in an area that covers more than half the  earth’s surface is one of few activities that has been studied and regulated to such a detailed extent before the activity has even taken place. while commercial seabed mining in international ocean areas has been delayed for the past twenty-five years, scientists have built an understanding of the deep-sea environment that, in turn, has allowed legal and environmental regulations for international seabed mining to be established and internationally adopted.
building on the success of this model, the international seabed authority established an endowment fund for collaborative marine scientific research. the purpose of the fund is to expand research opportunities in the deep-sea environments for the participation and inclusion of developing country scientists and other technical and research personnel.
governments, environmental and other non-governmental organizations, scientific and academic representatives, and others learned more about the isa endowment fund this week during a meeting on marine biodiversity taking place in new york at the united nations headquarters. the event included presentations by interridge coordinator, dr. stace beaulieu and chief marine geologist at the geological survey of brazil, mr. kaiser de souza. the government of the united kingdom also took the opportunity to announce a new financial contribution to increase the activities
of the fund.
“research in deep-sea areas is important for so many scientific, environmental, developmental and social reasons,” said mr. nandan. “i am encouraged by the growing number of partners in our endowment fund.”tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

the goals of the workshop are to understand the national, regional and international policies and laws;  to find a consensus on the design of the remps as well as the preliminary ideas for its framework; and  to produce a work plan for 2-3 years of scientific collaboration to collect and share the data needed for the design of the remp. 
in his opening statement, secretary-general michael lodge said that the environmental management objectives of the authority were (a) the prevention, reduction and control of pollution and other hazards to the marine environment; and (b) the protection and conservation of the natural resources of the area and the prevention of damage to the flora and fauna of the marine environment.
 
he continued that having remps in place in all mineral provinces where exploration occurs will create the enabling conditions to inform better decision-making processes as well as contribute to the effective management of activities undertaken in the area.
 
he emphasized that well-structured and organized information for the area where the authority has issued contracts is of utmost priority for the design of any remp. 
 
he also reaffirmed the importance of cooperation of stakeholders in the designing of remps, adding that while the prime responsibility is with the authority, the authority should cooperate with other competent international organizations, contractors and independent researchers, as appropriate.
 
the international seabed authority is the only international organization mandated by the united nations convention on the law of the sea to administer and manage, on behalf of the states parties to the convention, the mineral resources in the area.
 it is intended that the remp will be the second to be developed by the authority – the first was the environmental management plan (emp) for polymetallic nodules in the clarion-clipperton zone approved by the council (isba/18/c/22) in 2012.

speaking at the special session on deep seabed mining at the 88th meeting of the ocean studies board of the national academies of science in washington, the secretary-general of the international seabed authority, michael lodge said that the authority had approved 29 contracts for exploration covering more than 1.3 million square kilometres of the seabed. these contractors include states, state entities and private corporations sponsored both by developed and developing states.
he highlighted the nature of the underlying legal regime established by the law of the sea convention as the one factor that distinguished deep seabed mining from any other extractive activity.
he provided an overview of the current status of deep seabed mining from the perspective of the international seabed authority, as regulator, and identified some of the main factors that need to come into alignment in order for the industry to take off.
“seafloor minerals are the only example of a global resource that is under international management by an international organization. as such, the international seabed authority represents a unique experiment in international relations. “
he emphasized that while commercial production of seafloor minerals had not started, the authority had come a long way compared to where it was in 1982 and in 1994 when it was established in kingston, jamaica.
""all the indications are that we are at a decisive point in the long history of attempts to mine the deep seabed.  we are on the threshold of a new industry. but to go beyond this point requires tremendous financial investment and involves considerable risk."" 
the ocean studies board meeting was held from 13-15 november 2017. meeting highlights included new reports on polar icebreaker cost assessment and sustaining ocean observations to understand future changes in earth's climate and a special session on deep seabed mining.

the paper authored by  scientists thomas a. schlacher, amy r. baco, ashley a. rowden, timothy d. o’hara, malcolm r. clark, chris kelley and john f. dower conclude that several implications for the design of spatial management and conservation tools with respect to mining are :
conservation of seamounts outside the cobalt-rich crust region is unlikely to capture the full range of ecological features found inside the region; 
conservation areas need to encompass a broad bathymetric gradient; 
ideally, mining blocks on individual seamounts should not exceed 2 km in length. overall, the life history characteristics and morphological traits of the deep-water invertebrate fauna typical of seamounts in the region imply that any recovery from mechanical impacts is likely to be very slow.

the aim of the workshop was to provide biological information essential for effective conservation planning of deep sea features to assist in the development of environmental guidelines for mining operations on seamounts.
the results of the findings supersedes isa technical study no. 8 which was the results of an earlier study also commissioned by the isa to assess patterns of community composition and diversity on seamounts with and without cobalt-rich crusts and the factors that determine these patterns.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

the third set of regulations for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crust will be taken up at the 17th session in 2011. ferromanganese cruts and oxidized deposits are found throughout the global oceans on the flanks and summits of seamounts, ridges and plateaux that are important potential source for many other metallic and rare earth elements such as titanium, cerium, nickel, platinum, manganese, phosphorus, thallium, tellurium, zirconium, tungsten, bismuth and molybdenum.
on 7 may, the assembly elected 17 members to the council for a four year term from 2011-2013 subject to the understandings reached in the regional and interest groups.
on the recommendation of the council, the assembly also decided that the authority, in accordance with article 191 of the convention, would request the seabed disputes chamber of the international tribunal of the law of the sea, pursuant to article 131 of the tribunal’s rules, to render an advisory opinion on the nauru proposal.
during the session, the assembly also paused to remember victims of the earthquakes in haiti, chile and china. a minute of silence was also observed for the recent passing of the following: the president of poland, lech kacsynski, the former president of the international olympic committee, juan antonio samaranth; and one of the pioneers of the key figures in the negotiations leading to the adoption of the 1982 united convention on the law of the sea and a former judge of the international tribunal for the law of the sea, paul engo of cameroon; and the president of nigeria, alhaji umaru yardua.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

in his speech at the 65th session of the general assembly, isa secretary-general, nii  allotey odunton said one of the reasons why it was so important to establish a regulatory framework for sulphide exploration was because of the possibility that one or more states would wish to apply for exploration licences in the near future.  since the adoption of the regulations, two states have submitted applications for exploration licences.
secretary-general odunton continued that another milestone for the authority in 2010 was the decision by the council to request an advisory opinion from the seabed disputes chamber. this was a significant development for the convention regime as a whole in that the making of the request, and the manner in which it was dealt with by the council and the chamber, demonstrates that the system set out in the convention works. the fact that the authority and its political organs were willing and able to respond to difficulties in the interpretation of provisions of the convention in a responsible and constructive manner should give great comfort to individual states parties as well as to the future seabed mining industry.tweets by isbahqna",2021-04-16

the newly assembled auxiliary cutter (ac), is the third and final seafloor production tool (spt)  being built for nautilus minerals for polymetallic sulphides (also called seafloor massive sulphides) mining at its solwara 1 deposit in the bismarck sea off papua new guinea. nautilus has a production target of 1.2 to 1.6 metric tonnes per year of sulphides material containing copper and gold. the excavation and collection of mineralised material has been split into three individual tasks, which will each be carried out by a different seafloor production tool (spt) which comprise an auxiliary cutter (ac), a bulk cutter (bc) and a collecting machine (cm).
the ac is designed as the pioneering tool which prepares the rugged sea bed for the more powerful bc. these two tools gather the excavated material; the third, the cm, will collect the cut material by drawing it in as seawater slurry with internal pumps, pushing it through a flexible pipe to the subsea pump and on to the production support vessel (psv) via a riser and lifting system (rals). the assembly of the auxiliary cutter makes it the first of the three seafloor production tools to have been completed.    it weighs approximately 250 tonnes.
nautilus minerals, a canadian company with offices in australia, papua new guinea (png), tonga and fiji was granted its first mining lease in january 2011 for polymetallic sulphides deposits at the prospect known as solwara 1, in the territorial waters of papua new guinea. it also holds approximately 500,000 square kilometres of exploration areas, or tenement applications, in png, tonga, fiji, vanuatu, the solomon islands, new zealand and the central pacific. previous exploration has already identified mineralised seafloor systems in the bismarck sea and in tonga.
in 2012, the international seabed authority entered into a 15-year exploration contract with nautilus minerals subsidiary, tonga offshore mining limited (toml) for exploration for polymetallic nodules in the clarion-clipperton fracture zone.

this initiative reflects the increasing interest and associated concerns on the potential impacts of deep sea minerals exploration and mining and how responsible authorities (i.e. governments and the isa) will regulate this emerging economic development opportunity in a sustainable manner both within national jurisdiction and in the area.
the objectives of this workshop are:
to increase awareness of the nature of the mineral resources in marine areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (“the area”), and on the outer continental shelf, and the measures taken by the international seabed authority with regard to the protection of the marine environment from the harmful effects of deep seabed mining and the applicability of such measures to the development of marine minerals within national jurisdiction.
to formulate preliminary recommendations for environmental impact assessments (eia) of seabed mining both within and beyond national jurisdiction.

although neither the authority nor spc/sopac can provide financial support, anyone interested in participating in the workshop can contact adam cook.

in the first report, secretary-general nii allotey odunton (ghana) provided information on the status of prospecting and of contracts for exploration for polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the deep seabed area (isba/20/c/12 and isba/20/c/12/add.1 ). it included information on the status of the periodic review of the implementation of the exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules between the international seabed authority and the government of india.
status of prospecting
the report stated that on september 6, 2011, the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources of germany (bgr) had expressed its intention to engage in prospecting for polymetallic sulphides in the area of the southern central indian ridge and the northern southeast indian ridge. the first annual report from bgr was received on 23 december 2013 and submitted to the legal and technical commission in february, 2014.    the second, submitted on 22 may 2014, had been placed before the commission at its july session.
           status of exploration contracts
the secretary-general stated that 17 contracts for exploration were in force. this includes 12 contracts for exploration for polymetallic nodules, three for exploration for polymetallic sulphides and two for exploration for cobalt crusts. a complete list of contracts, including details of the contractor and date of entry into force of each contract, is provided in annex 1 to the report.
according to the report, since the nineteenth session, two plans of work for exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts that had been approved by the council in july 2013 (see isba/19/c/13 and isba/19/c/15 ) were prepared in the form of contracts. on 27 january 2014, a contract with japan oil, gas and metals national corporation (jogmec) was concluded in tokyo. the contract with the china ocean mineral resources research and development association (comra) was signed in beijing on 29 april 2014.
seven more applications are under consideration by the legal and technical commission, and if all are approved by the council during its current session, the number of exploration contracts will total 26.
periodic review of the implementation of the plan of work for exploration by the overnment of india
the report states that the five-yearly review process regarding the contract for exploration for polymetallic nodules with the government of india was formally concluded by exchange of letters dated 6 march 2014.
status of consultations regarding the implementation of the assembly decision on overhead charges
part of the report highlights the application of the decision adopted by the assembly on 25 july 2013 (isba/19/a/12 ) which established an annual overhead charge of $47,000 to cover the cost of administration and supervision of contracts with the authority.  the secretary-general explained that for those contractors who signed contracts after the date of the decision, the two amended standard clauses of the contract relating to the annual charge (sections 10.5 and 10.6 of annex 4) were automatically included, and payment was to be made by 31 march of each year.   
with regard to the 14 contractors who had signed before the 25 july 2013, the secretary-general said he had been instructed to engage in discussions with them to determine when payment would be made. so far, he had contacted five contractors: japan oil gas and metals national corporation (jogmec), china ocean mineral resources research and development association (comra), the government of the republic of korea, marawa research and exploration ltd, and l’institut francais de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer (ifremer). while jogmec, comra and the government of korea had agreed to incorporate the clauses into their contracts, negotiations were continuing with ifremer and marawa research and exploration ltd.
discussion on the report
deliberation on the report included comments and questions from brazil, cuba, france, germany, india, mexico, senegal, south africa, and trinidad & tobago.
leading the discussion on the status of prospecting, the representative from germany called for more binding regulations and urged the authority “not to abandon this instrument and allow it to become meaningless”. the representative expressed concern that the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources of germany (bgr) was the only applicant for prospecting for polymetallic sulphides. brazil agreed on the need to revisit the regulations on prospecting to make it more attractive and possibly more binding.
responding, the secretary-general outlined the stages undertaken by prospectors in the search for deposits of minerals, including notification to the authority of the area of interest, refinement and mapping of the proposed area, and approval from the authority. the secretary-general said contractors were given exclusive rights to the area for 15 years to conduct activities resulting in important data and information that the authority secured for the common heritage of mankind.
the secretary-general said prospecting was an integral part of any mineral development.  it was as important an activity as exploitation itself. he said prospecting was expensive but the valuable data provided an estimate on the amount of resources available for exploitation.
annual overhead charges
 
trinidad and tobago expressed concern that some contractors had not yet accepted the amendments to their contracts and hoped that the secretary-general could find some means of ensuring that all would adhere to the decision of the assembly. france indicated that ‘positive consultations’ had taken place between the ifremer and the secretariat and that arrangements would be made to include the relevant amended clauses by the end of the year. mexico and south africa commended the efforts of the secretariat in ensuring that contractors remained compliant.
delegations voiced queries about what would happen to the information collected from contractors. south africa asked whether the authority had a system in place to receive that information, especially from those contractors whose contracts would expire in the next two or three years, and who had the right to apply for an extension for exploration or a plan of work for exploitation. cuba sought clarification on whether there was a policy on dissemination of information gathered by contractors after the expiration of their contracts, and whether information was available for purchase or to be utilised for the common heritage of mankind.
in his response, the secretary-general said that the authority did not have sufficient data with which to build a database. furthermore, he emphasised that information from the various contractors was not standardized and therefore difficult to merge. he pointed out that ‘tried and true’ standards existed for land-based mining, which were invaluable to financial investors in their decisions to lend. such standards did not exist for seabed mining; however, the secretary general suggested that discussions could begin on how to introduce these standards to the work of the authority.
report on national legislation
the second report of the secretary-general dealt with the status of national legislation on deep seabed mining and related matters.
on 1 february 2011, the seabed disputes chamber of the international tribunal for the law of the sea affirmed, at the request of the council of the authority, that the convention requires a sponsoring state to adopt, within its legal system, laws and regulations and to take administrative measures to ensure compliance by the contractor with its obligations and to exempt the sponsoring state from liability.
the council, at the authority’s seventeenth session in 2011, adopted a decision requesting the secretary general to update on an annual basis a report on legislation enacted by sponsoring states and other members of the authority pertaining to activities in the area. 
presenting his report (isba/ 20/c/11 ) to the council this afternoon, the secretary-general said that since the authority’s nineteenth session in 2013, belgium had promulgated two laws, in july and august 2013, concerning prospecting, exploration for and exploitation of the resources in the area and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
an addendum to the report (isba/20/c11/add.1 ) stated that the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland had informed the authority on 4 july 2014 in a note verbale that royal assent had been given on 14 may 2014 to the deep sea mining act 2014. it was to enter into force on 14 july 2014.
the following member states had also, as of 4 july 2014,  provided information on or texts of relevant national legislation: belgium, china, the cook islands, the czech republic, fiji, france, germany, guyana, japan, mexico, nauru, the netherlands, new zealand, oman, the republic of korea, tonga, the united kingdom of great british and northern ireland, and zambia.  the united states had also provided relevant information and text to the secretariat. a submission had also been received from the south pacific commission on behalf of the pacific islands region. the information regarding national legislation is available on the authority’s website.
the report indicated that the secretariat would continue to keep the online database updated as new information was received. it was also undertaking a comparative study of the existing national legislation to analyze common elements that might be contained in them.
annexed to the report is the complete list of legislative instruments provided by sponsoring states and other members of the authority.
discussion on national legislation
in the discussion following the secretary-general’s presentation of his report, a number of delegations, including brazil and china, welcomed the secretariat’s commitment to undertake a comparative study of the existing national legislation. germany expressed willingness to assist in the exercise. the netherlands, recalling previous discussions on the drafting of model legislation to guide member states, suggested that the secretariat could prepare a guidance document derived from general principles set out in international legislative instruments in time for the next session.
the representative of the united kingdom explained that his government had thought it prudent to update its existing legislation now that the exploitation phase was imminent, in order to ensure consistency with the convention and the implementation agreement. china, tonga and trinidad and tobago indicated that their governments were in the process of developing legislation to govern activities in the area.
australia asked whether the secretariat had done any analysis to ascertain whether legislation submitted by members was in keeping with the guidelines set out in the advisory opinion of the international tribunal for the law of the sea (itlos).
in his response, the legal counsel stated that no such analysis had been done but suggested that the comparative study to be undertaken could take the guidelines of itlos into account. he confirmed that all countries passing new legislation were taking the advisory opinion very seriously, and that there was emphasis on prohibiting any activities to proceed in the area except through the authority. he further stated that with legislation being developed rapidly in some countries, the authority’s database would become a valuable resource for member states in the coming years.

a requirement of regulation 31, part v of the regulations on prospecting and exploration for polymetallic nodules in the area includes proposals for areas to be set aside and used exclusively as impact reference zones, and the preservation of these zones.  a similar provision is replicated in the regulations on prospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts.
the workshop will be a forum for the isa, its contractors, and scientific and technical experts to exchange information and develop a common understanding of the key elements of reference area design and monitoring principles applicable to exploitation contracts for deep-sea minerals.
irz areas will be used for assessing the effect of each contractor’s activities on the marine environment, whereas in prz areas, there will be no mining activity to ensure representative and stable biota of the seabed in order to assess any changes in the flora and fauna of the marine environment.
workshop objectives will include the development of a reproducible and transparent procedure to:

describe, categorize and map the contract areas, 


select impact and preservation reference zones, 


deliver baseline information on the selected zones to the isa and stakeholders,


perform monitoring of irzs and przs designations, including post mining monitoring as part of closure plans/contractor commitment, 


perform impact assessments, 


file timely reports on the monitoring activities, and,


guarantee public accessibility to all work and reports.

the workshop aims to contribute to the required criteria for irzs and przs as an element of environmental monitoring programmes and determine the design and monitoring principles, to help ensure a consistent application of irz and prz concepts.

following the council’s meeting, the authority’s assembly concluded its work for the 22nd session, approving a two-year budget of $17,130,700 for 2017 to 2018.  
a ten-paragraph draft proposal by mexico on the election of members of the commission helped the council to arrive at a compromise after lengthy debate. the draft decision was approved by consensus.
at its morning meeting of the council, president mariusz jedrysek invited members to take up once again, agenda item 17 relating to the election of members of the legal and technical commission as the council had been unable to reach consensus during meetings on this matter over the past two days. the discussions focused on the number of members that should serve on the commission as well as the geographic distribution of the membership.  
some delegations suggested expanding the membership to 30 members in order to accommodate the 30 candidates whose nominations had been received on time.  others preferred to limit the number to 25, while remaining mindful of the issue of equitable geographic distribution. a third proposal sought to expand the commission to 36 members: the 30 candidates who had been nominated on time, as well as two members nominated by each of the three regional groups which are underrepresented on the commission, in an effort to achieve equitable geographic distribution.  this last proposal led to a draft decision formulated by australia in collaboration with other delegations during a suspension of the meeting. 
the council decided to request the secretary-general, in consultation with the commission, to provide a report for consideration by the council at the next session, recommending the ideal size of the commission. the report would also propose a mechanism which would ensure that future elections would take into account the importance of members’ expertise and the need for equitable geographic distribution.  
the draft decision reads as follows:
the council of the international seabed authority,
1.    considered the election of members of the legal and technical commission for the period 2017 to 2021;
2.    recalling article 163 (3) and (4) of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, which provides that candidates nominated for the commission shall have appropriate qualifications in the area of competence of the authority and that in the election of members, due account shall be taken of the need for equitable geographic distribution and the representation of special interests;
3.    noting the ongoing general and systematic review of the manner in which the international regime of the area has operated in practice pursuant to article 154 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea and anticipating the relevance of the outcomes of that review for future consideration of the size and composition of the commission;
4.    requests that the secretary-general, in consultation with the commission, provide a report by 31 december 2016, for consideration by the council at the 23rd session, identifying the ideal size of the commission and proposing a mechanism which would ensure that future elections are undertaken in a manner which better taken into account all the considerations set out in [paragraph 2] of this decision, including equitable geographic distribution;
5.    decides that no later than the 25th session, the council will, having considered the report requested in paragraph 4 of this decision, and set a clear and binding decision setting a process to govern the next elections of the commission.
6.    noting that future elections shall be informed by consideration of the report requested in paragraph 4 of this decision, decided, on an exceptional and temporary basis, and without prejudice to future elections, and having due regard to economy and efficiency, to increase the number of members of the commission to 30.
7.    alt: further decided that in the consideration of the size of the commission for the following term, the starting basis should be 25, taking into account the report requested in paragraph 4 of this decision, and the outcomes of the article 154 review.

he said that at the second session of the authority in march1996 when agreement was reached on the composition of the council, it had laboured through “a series of highs and lows” to reach a stage where consideration was being given to the completion of a mining code for polymetallic nodules in the near future.
mr. odunton observed that he had been fortunate for the opportunity to have worked with the council since its inception and wished the members the “very best” in their endeavours. he reminded them to keep their eyes “on the prize” which was the sustainable mining of the deep seabed mineral resources.  mr. odunton received a standing ovation following his brief address to the council.

“in 2018, the council endorsed a strategy for the development of remps and agreed on two key principles to guide the future work. first, all remps should be developed under the auspices of the authority.  second, remps should be developed in priority areas before exploitation starts. this includes the area of the northern mid-atlantic ridge, where we have three contracts for exploration for polymetallic sulphide deposits,” said mr. lodge.

addressing the workshop participants, the ambassador of the russian federation in jamaica, mr vladimir vinokurov, underscored the importance of this workshop as a means to “give a new impetus for international cooperation on the noble work of effective development of the mineral resources in the global ocean.”

mr. felix leinemann, head of unit at the dg mare of the european commission also emphasized the importance of the event and stressed that it was “an important step towards an  isa environmental policy framework which is robust, in line with international commitments, and containing strong and enforceable environmental standards, including prior environmental impact assessments.”

once finalized, the workshop report will be presented to the next meeting of the legal and technical commission for its consideration.

the finance committee (fc) of isa is in the process of developing recommendations on an appropriate mechanism for the equitable sharing of the financial benefits (in the form of royalties) generated by seabed minerals exploitation in the area. the work undertaken so far on this topic has led to the development of two substantive reports presented to the fc in july 2019 and april 2020 respectively, and to the development of three alternative formulae for fair and equitable allocation to individual member states of a given sum of royalties available for distribution. the formulae under consideration are based on the calculation of each country’s population as a percentage of the world’s population; using established measures in a manner fully consistent with aristotle’s principle of equity or proportionality. this distribution would then be adjusted through a social distribution weight in such a way as to redistribute income from higher income state parties to the developing countries referenced in article 140 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea.

as an adjunct to the above distribution formula, or as an alternative, the fc is also exploring the concept of a ‘seabed sustainability fund’ (or global fund). although further work is needed to develop the purpose of this fund, the overall philosophy behind its establishment is to channel part, or all, of the financial benefits generated by seabed minerals exploitation into programmes, projects and activities that are consistent with the status of seabed minerals as the common heritage of mankind.

isa is therefore seeking a consultant with requisite experience in economics and related fields to undertake a study in line with the terms of reference of work in the annex to the call and invites proposals are to be submitted via email to eosg@isa.org.jm by 18 september 2020.

organized by isa, in partnership with the ministry of oceans and fisheries of the republic of korea and the national marine biodiversity institute of korea, the side-event provided an opportunity to take stock of isa’s contribution to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity of the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, termed by the un convention on the law of the sea (unclos) as the  “area.”
most notably, participants recognized isa’s unique role as the only organization with a mandate to develop measures and tools to provide for the effective protection of the marine environment in the area.
key milestones included: the establishment of nine areas of particular environmental interest (apeis), which are fully protected from mining within the clarion-clipperton zone; the development of a central database designed to host all existing available deep-sea environmental information; and recent progress made in developing draft regulations to govern exploitation, including detailed provisions relating to environmental impact assessments (eias).
in his opening statement, isa’s legal counsel and deputy to the secretary-general, mr. alfonso ascencio-herrera, underscored that 2019 marks a triple anniversary. it has been 25 years since unclos entered into force, isa was established, and the part xi implementing agreement was adopted.
mr.  ascencio-herrera also highlighted that since 1994, the area has been managed through isa based on equality between states under a comprehensive legal regime that is designed to achieve the sustainable use of marine mineral resources for the benefit of mankind.
in his opening remarks, co-chair admiral md khurshed alam of bangladesh further emphasized the universal character of unclos, and the major innovation introduced by the 1994 agreement.    
h.e mr courtenay rattray, jamaican ambassador to the un, and mr. myeong-rae park, ministry of oceans and fisheries of the republic of korea, delivered congratulatory messages to mark isa’s 25th anniversary, highlighting the importance of cooperation among member states and stakeholders.
ambassador rattray expressed that jamaica was proud to host isa and highlighted that one of isa’s strengths is its continued efforts to evolve. mr. park further emphasized the importance of capacity-building and the role of isa in this regard.
the panel discussion provided an opportunity to emphasize key lessons learnt from isa’s work over the last 25 years, which could contribute to the deliberation of delegates at the bbnj conference. particular attention was given to the existing framework developed for eias, along with isa’s experience in addressing potential environmental impacts through the development of regulations, rules and procedures. delegates also noted isa’s significant contribution in delivering meaningful capacity-building activities and welcomed the introduction of standardized approaches for regional environmental management planning, that would enable better engagement of stakeholders

he succeeds mr. nii allotey odunton of ghana, who has been secretary-general since 2009. the president of the assembly, rear admiral md khurshed alam (rtd) (bangladesh), presided over the elections in accordance with the rules of procedure of the authority.
statements were made after the assembly’s decision by the sponsors of the two candidates, chairmen of the regional groups, and individual delegations.
also this morning, the assembly heard a statement by the prime minister of trinidad and tobago, dr. keith rowley. it approved the report of the credentials committee.
election of secretary-general
    
to facilitate the achievement of the consensus an informal indicative vote was carried out with the agreement of the two candidates – nii allotey odunton, sponsored by ghana, and michael w. lodge, sponsored by the united kingdom.  the process was employed in 1996 to elect the first secretary-general of the authority, ambassador satya nandan of fiji, 
prime minister of trinidad and tobago
prime minister keith rowley of trinidad and tobago addressing the assembly earlier, said the mandate of the international seabed authority must be expanded to make it responsible for helping states implement their obligations under the future legal instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
dr. rowley, who is on an official visit to jamaica, said his country, like other developing countries, believed that all marine resources in the deep seabed area beyond national jurisdiction were the common heritage of mankind. that should be a cardinal principle founded in the future convention, he added.
(the authority, under the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea, administers the mineral resources of the deep seabed beyond areas of national jurisdiction,
a preparatory committee of the united nations general assembly is working on the elements of the legally binding instrument under the future convention).
dr. rowley expressed the commitment of his government to work with the authority and all of its member states to achieve their common objective. it was doing so due to trinidad and tobago’s “distinguished and historical contribution” to many facets of the law of the sea which predated its negotiation, adoption and entry into force.       
in his statement, dr. rowley also said the authority should as a matter of priority work on the resolution of important practical issues germane to the uniform implementation of article 82 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea. (the article states that it was a duty of states to make contributions in kind with regard to production from non-living resources of the outer continental shelf – that is areas beyond the 200 nautical mile limit.)
he noted that a number of states had received favourable recommendations from the commission on the limits of the continental shelf to establish the outer limits of their continental shelf. states could ill afford “to sit and wait” until there was exploitation of the mineral resources in those areas, he stated.

he stressed to the meeting that he looked forward to working with states parties over the next four years of his term.
he urged landlocked developing countries (lldcs) not party to the convention to join the convention and not miss out on the provisions in part xi specifically intended for their benefit. he also urged states parties to ratify the part xi agreement, and encouraged states parties to join the protocol on the privileges and immunities of the authority.
the secretary-general emphasized one of the most important tasks for the assembly this year as being the consideration of the final report of the committee established under article 154 of the convention to undertake a periodic review of the way in which the part xi regime has operated.  the final report of the committee contains 19 recommendations for consideration by the assembly - reduced from the original 55 draft recommendations.
among the most important are recommendations for a strategic plan to guide the work of the authority; an enhanced role for the assembly in setting policy; an increase of transparency across all the organs of the authority; an enhanced internal functioning of the secretariat; and a revised pattern of meetings to promote broader participation,  to reflect the fact that the work of the authority has changed radically since 1994. as regards the latter recommendation, he mentioned that he has prepared a proposal for a revised schedule of meetings for 2018 and 2019 and has devised a system to give pre-eminence to the assembly as the supreme organ of the authority. 
on other activities of the authority, secretary-general lodge said “the chief priority for the authority at this time is to deliver a mining code that will enable contractors to move from exploration to exploitation.”
he said the authority had collaborated with two german agencies, bgr and uba, to convene an international workshop in berlin on environmental regulation of deep seabed mining and had collaborated with amdc, grid-arendal and pew charitable trusts in convening a workshop in kampala, uganda on the prospects for africa of developing the resources of the continental shelf and deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction.
mr. lodge referred also to the active participation of the authority at the recent united nations conference to support the implementation of sdg14 (ocean conference).  he indicated that  the authority has  registered seven voluntary commitments for the ocean conference, including one in collaboration with un-desa and two in collaboration with the african minerals development centre of uneca and had made interventions in plenary as well as in partnership dialogues 5 and 6.  he continued that he was also privileged to be invited as a panelist in partnership dialogue 7, on the implementation of international law as reflected in unclos, so as to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources. 
he concluded by expressing appreciation to the host government of jamaica for their tremendous support of the authority.

……………………..

the international seabed authority (isa) will convene a workshop on the development of a regional environmental management plan (remp) for the area of the northern mid-atlantic ridge (mar) with a focus on polymetallic sulphides (pms) deposits, from 23 november to 4 december 2020 (week days only), via an online meeting platform.

the workshop was originally scheduled to take place in st. petersburg, russian federation, in june 2020. however, due to the implications associated with the pandemic of covid-19, decision has been made to postpone it. the workshop will be held in collaboration with the atlantic remp project funded by the european union, the ministry of natural resources and environment of the russian federation and the all-russia scientific research institute for geology and mineral resources of the ocean (vniiokeangeologia).

building on the results of previous remp workshops, in particular the évora workshop, the workshop aims to:

speaking to the hamburg business club about new developments in deep seabed mining, isa secretary-general michael lodge said that even though no commercial exploitation is taking place, deep sea mining remains a frontier industry with its pace increasing over the past several years including rapid development in all sectors of the industry.
 “it has been a long and arduous road to turn the promise of seabed mining into commercial reality. at various times, and in various combinations, these have included technical, financial, legal and political challenges”.
“it is not enough to just have a resource. in order to promote investment, we also need technology and regulation. technology in my view should no longer be regarded as a limiting factor”. he added that the council of the authority had reiterated its commitment to adopt the regulations by 2020 whilst recognizing that additional work will be required on standards and guidelines to support the implementation of the regulations and that many of these will evolve over time.
he also highlighted  that the convention makes it clear that, as a regulator, the authority has the responsibility to protect the marine environment from the harmful impacts of mining and must develop environmental regulations that ensure that exploration and exploitation take place in a manner that prevents serious harm to the marine environment, both on the ocean floor and in the water column. at the same time, contractors must reduce, mitigate and, as far as possible, prevent harmful impacts and pollution that can affect wider ecosystems and habitats. these are very high environmental standards, and certainly not less than any other ocean-based industry.
in concluding, he said that seabed mining offered substantial potential for developing high-grade, abundant, mineral resources over the long term and in this context, the contribution of deep seabed mining towards increased long-term demand for minerals must be part of the overall vision for a sustainable world.
