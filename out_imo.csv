                                    covid-19 crew change crisis still a challenge - imo secretary-general 
                                
                                
                                    crew change crisis is far from over and issues around vaccination need to be resolved.
                                
                                based on industry analysis, the numbers of seafarers requiring repatriation after finishing their contracts had declined - from a high of around 400,000 in september 2020 - to around 200,000 as of march 2021
                                    the crew change crisis caused by covid-19 restrictions continues to cause challenges, despite some improvement in the numbers, the secretary-general of the international maritime organization has warned.  in a statement, secretary-general kitack lim said that based on industry analysis, the numbers of seafarers requiring repatriation after finishing their contracts had declined - from a high of around 400,000 in september 2020 - to around 200,000 as of march 2021, with a similar number waiting to join ships. however, this number could rise again. but the crew change crisis is far from over.  importantly, issues around vaccination need to be resolved. now, more than ever, seafarers need to be designated as key workers to ensure priority vaccination and access to safe transit and travel, mr lim said.   full statement from imo secretary-general kitack lim:  <U+0093>one year ago, as the world plunged into the covid-19 crisis, i spoke of our voyage together and the need for collaboration and cooperation. i am glad to say that over these past 12 months, we have worked intensely with many different stakeholders to address challenging conditions.  the maritime sector has continued to deliver the vital supplies that people need. seafarers have worked tirelessly, at the heart of this trade, to keep goods flowing. despite difficulties with port access, repatriation, crew changes and more, there can be no denying that seafarers have gone beyond the call of duty.   hundreds of thousands of seafarers have been forced to work long beyond their contracted time. we have estimated that throughout the last months of 2020 and up to the beginning of this year, 400,000 seafarers still needed to be repatriated, with a similar number needing to join ships.  thanks to concerted efforts by governments, shipowners and others, this figure is now estimated at 200,000 seafarers needing repatriation and a similar number needing to join ships. one of the major achievements of last year contributing to this was the adoption of the united nations assembly resolution calling on un member states to designate seafarers and other marine personnel as key workers and to implement relevant measures to allow stranded seafarers to be repatriated and others to join ships, and to ensure access to medical care.  but we cannot be complacent. fewer than 60 countries so far have heeded our call for seafarers to be designated as key workers. more countries need to do so if we are to resolve this crisis and ensure seafarers are treated fairly and so that their travel to and from their place of work is properly facilitated. there is still a long way to go before we are back to a normal crew change regime.  as vaccination is rolled out in many countries, i urge governments to prioritize seafarers in their national covid-19 vaccination programmes.   governments should also identify and prepare for the challenges of the vaccination of seafarers who spend long periods of time away from their home countries. we need to continue to work together to develop relevant protocols and guidance around vaccine certification. this is particularly important as any barriers to travel created by national vaccine protocols may further complicate an already difficult crew-change situation. on our voyage through this pandemic, which has been challenging for the whole world, i recognize that many seafarers have endured intense hardship as they have worked to keep trade flowing. i wholeheartedly thank seafarers for this.  we will continue to work with our sister un agencies, with industry bodies and with governments to address the ongoing needs of seafarers. we will also be looking towards taking the lessons learned going forward, so we can be better prepared in the future.<U+0094>",2021-04-16

                                <U+200B>both imo and the shipping sector - as well as refineries and fuel (bunker) suppliers - have been rigorously preparing for the new limit. for most ships this will mean a switch to new types of compliant fuel oils, so-called very low sulphur fuel oil (vlsfo), or marine gas/diesel oil. the vlsfo blends are new to the market. 
                                    ""imo 2020"" requirements for ships to cut sulphur oxide emissions enter into effect in just over one month's time. this will significantly reduce air pollution from ships with positive benefits for human health and the environment. the new requirement means that the global limit for sulphur in fuel oil used on board ships will be reduced to 0.50% m/m (mass by mass). within designated emission control areas (ecas), the limit will remain at 0.10%. the new limit will be mandatory, under a regulation in annex vi of imo's marpol convention for the prevention of pollution from ships.both the organization and the shipping sector - as well as refineries and fuel (bunker) suppliers - have been rigorously preparing for the new limit. for most ships this will mean a switch to new types of compliant fuel oils, so-called very low sulphur fuel oil (vlsfo), or marine gas/diesel oil. the vlsfo blends are new to the market. imo has issued comprehensive guidance (outlined in imo 2020 leaflet), and the shipping industry has developed guidance, including imo 2020 ics guidance on compliance for shipping companies and crews, joint industry guidance on supply and use of 0.50% sulphur marine fuel  and intertanko 2020 practical guide training videos are also available (sulphur 2020 training package including video, free to download). preparedness for this major change for the shipping sector was highlighted at a roundtable industry meeting hosted by imo at its london headquarters (18 november), following a previous meeting in june. an imo symposium on imo 2020 and alternative fuels in october also brought together stakeholders, including member states, the shipping and  refineries sector, who confirmed a general readiness to meet the sulphur 2020 requirement. the roundtable meeting saw increasing confidence towards consistent implementation resulting from significant efforts to date by all stakeholders and emphasized the continued need for awareness-raising efforts as the deadline looms. availability of compliant fuel oil views were exchanged on the general availability of fuel to meet the 0.50% limit. it was felt supply would generally be available, with some exceptions. there was some indication that heavy fuel oils continued to be loaded. however, due to the proximity to the deadline, more ship operators and owners are beginning to gain experience of compliant fuels as bunker suppliers move their storage infrastructure and bunker barges to be 0.50% compliant fuel oil ready.  information on compliant fuel oil specification the imo secretariat encouraged the sharing of information on any testing of fuel oils meeting the 0.50% limit. in addition to the imo 2020 ics guidance, joint industry guidance and intertanko 2020 practical guide, attention was also drawn to the recently-published ""cimac guideline: marine fuel handling in connection to stability and compatibility"", issued by the international council of combustion engines (cimac).enforcement and complianceconsistent enforcement by port state control was once again recognised as essential to ensure a level playing field and to ensure that ships would not be disproportionately impactedmarpol annex vi, which contains the sulphur limit regulation, has 95 parties, who between them register 96.71% or world merchant shipping by tonnage. flag states have jurisdiction over the ship and issue the international air pollution prevention certificate (iapp) to ships of 400 gross tonnage and above.  however, port states need to be a party to annex vi to exercise port state control in relation to the sulphur 2020 limit. the number of parties to the annex varies in different port state control regions. concerns were raised by some attendees on the preparedness of  the psc regimes to enforce the 2020 sulphur limit. the imo secretariat confirmed the organization's readiness to support psc regimes, in particular, with capacity building and training, and highlighted workshops delivered with the support of denmark and the world maritime university (wmu).  specific training to support port state control for the implementation of marpol annex vi could be provided. an imo workshop for psc mou/agreement secretaries and database managers will be convened in 2020, which would provide a further opportunity to promote the harmonization of enforcement measures. fuel oil non-availability report (fonar) roundtable participants raised concern about possible inconsistent approaches in relation to the fuel oil non-availability report (fonar). the report is not intended as an exemption but is a standardised template to report non-availability of compliant fuel oil.  the imo secretariat reminded participants that imo has issued the 2019 guidelines on consistent implementation of 0.50% sulphur limit under marpol annex vi (mepc.320(74) here), which includes a standardised fonar. preparation essential participants agreed on the need to continue to raise awareness about the sulphur 2020 limit and the need for further preparation by all stakeholders, including the imo secretariat, psc regimes, member states,  shipowners/operators, charterers, fuel suppliers and others, in order to ensure consistent implementation of the sulphur 2020 limit by 1 january 2020. in this regard, it was agreed that the imo secretariat would communicate to all relevant parties on the continuing need to prepare for the entry into force of the sulphur limit. resources: imo web page on sulphur 2020 answers frequently asked questions and includes an imo leaflet (download here) which outlines the requirement, answers the most frequently asked questions about the rule and provides a list of the imo instruments supporting implementation, best practice guidance, port state control and sampling guidelines and others.  imo has published a compilation of all related guidance, best practices and so on, as a single imo publication (hard copy and electronic formats).

                                    scoping exercise begins, to look into how safe, secure and environmentally sound maritime autonomous surface ship operations may be addressed in imo instruments.
                                
                                the maritime safety committee (msc) endorsed a framework for a regulatory scoping exercise, as work in progress, including preliminary definitions of maritime autonomous surface ships (mass) and degrees of autonomy, as well as a methodology for conducting the exercise and a plan of work.
                                    the international maritime organization (imo) – the global regulatory body for international shipping - has commenced work to look into how safe, secure and environmentally sound maritime autonomous surface ships (mass) operations may be addressed in imo instruments.the organization’s senior technical body, the maritime safety committee (msc), endorsed a framework for a regulatory scoping exercise, as work in progress, including preliminary definitions of mass and degrees of autonomy, as well as a methodology for conducting the exercise and a plan of work. for the purpose of the regulatory scoping exercise, “maritime autonomous surface ship (mass)” is defined as a ship which, to a varying degree, can operate independently of human interaction. to facilitate the progress of the regulatory scoping exercise, the degrees of autonomy are organized (non-hierarchically) as follows (it was noted that mass could be operating at one or more degrees of autonomy for the duration of a single voyage):  ship with automated processes and decision support: seafarers are on board to operate and control shipboard systems and functions. some operations may be automated. remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board: the ship is controlled and operated from another location, but seafarers are on board.remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board: the ship is controlled and operated from another location. there are no seafarers on board.fully autonomous ship: the operating system of the ship is able to make decisions and determine actions by itself.as a first step, the scoping exercise will identify current provisions in an agreed list of imo instruments and assess how they may or may not be applicable to ships with varying degrees of autonomy and/or whether they may preclude mass operations. as a second step, an analysis will be conducted to determine the most appropriate way of addressing mass operations, taking into account, inter alia, the human element, technology and operational factors. the msc, which was meeting for its 99th session (16-25 may), established a correspondence group on mass to test the framework of the regulatory scoping exercise agreed at the session and, in particular, the methodology, and report back to its next session, msc 100 (3-7 december 2018).    the correspondence group will test the methodology by conducting an initial assessment of solas regulation iii/17-1 (recovery of persons from the water), which requires all ships to have ship-specific plans and procedures for recovery of persons from the water; solas regulation v/19.2 (carriage requirements for carriage of shipborne navigational equipment and systems); and load lines regulation 10 (information to be supplied to the master). if time allows, it will also consider solas regulations ii-1/3-4 (emergency towing arrangements and procedures) and v/22 (navigation bridge visibility).the committee further invited interested member states and international organizations to submit proposals related to the development of interim guidelines for mass trials to its next session, msc 100.treaties under consideration the list of instruments to be covered in the msc’s scoping exercise for mass includes those covering safety (solas); collision regulations (colreg); loading and stability (load lines); training of seafarers and fishers (stcw, stcw-f); search and rescue (sar); tonnage measurement (tonnage convention); and special trade passenger ship instruments (space stp, stp). imo in 2017 adopted strategic directions for the organization, including one on the integration of new and advancing technologies in the regulatory framework - balancing the benefits derived from new and advancing technologies against safety and security concerns, the impact on the environment and on international trade facilitation, the potential costs to the industry, and their impact on personnel, both on board and ashore.speaking at the opening of the msc meeting, imo secretary-general kitack lim highlighted the importance of remaining flexible to accommodate new technologies, and so improve the efficiency of shipping, “while at the same time keeping in mind the role of the human element and the need to maintain safe navigation, further reducing the number of marine casualties and incidents”. click for msc photos. click for opening speech by imo secretary-general kitack lim.

                                    an important reference set of protocols to ensure safe ship crew changes and travel during the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic has been recognized by imo's technical body, the maritime safety committee (msc). the committee, meeting virtually for its 102nd session (4 to 11 november) approved an msc circular recognizing the industry-developed protocols, which set out general measures and procedures designed to ensure that ship crew changes and travel can take place safely during the pandemic. currently, hundreds of thousands of seafarers are stranded on board ships, having seen their contracts extended beyond the maximum duration of service periods accepted under international treaties, i.e. less than 12 months, and a similar number of seafarers are waiting to join ships.the protocols also emphasize the need for governments to designate seafarers as key workers, providing an essential service. the protocols (previously issued via circular letter) include practical steps for joining and leaving ships, including the need for compliance and strict adherence with covid-19 testing and quarantine requirements, and measures to prevent infection on board ships. they are a living document which will be updated in line with developments concerning the pandemic.the move to issue the crew change protocols via an official imo circular (msc.1/circ.1636) was one of a number of actions taken by the committee to support efforts by un agencies, the maritime industry and governments to address the crew change crisis, a very serious humanitarian issue for seafarers which threatens the safety of navigation and world trade. (read more here.)information on focal points and ports which facilitate crew changeup-to-date information on national focal points and on ports which facilitate crew changes will be made available on a new module in imo's global integrated shipping information system (gisis), following the agreement of the committee. seafarer symbolthe msc agreed that imo, working with the international labour organization (ilo) and the international civil aviation organization (icao), develop a universal non-text logo or symbol that enables seafarers to identify, and consequently access, dedicated resources and processes on ship, in port and in transit to/from ships. such a logo will have a longer-term benefit by guiding seafarers to services which should ultimately support better safety outcomes.delay in delivery of ships – interpretation agreed the msc agreed a unified interpretation related to delays in delivery of ships, during the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. the unified interpretation of solas regulation ii-1/3-10 concerns the term ""unforeseen delay in delivery of ships"". imo has issued circular letter no.4204/add.1 on implementation and enforcement of relevant imo instruments in light of the covid-19 pandemic, which calls for understanding and close cooperation among all member states to overcome the challenges related to the implementation and enforcement of imo instruments.remote surveys the committee discussed a proposal to develop guidance on the implementation of remote surveys. the proposal recognises that the use of remote survey is expected to continue to increase in the years ahead, even after  the pandemic ends.interested member states and international organizations to submit a new output proposal. the committee noted that developing such guidance would require detailed technical consideration by experts, which should also include matters related to cases of force majeure.adoption of amendments and other mattersthe maritime safety committee also progressed its work on a wide range of important technical matters, including adoption of amendments and guidelines. details to follow.",2021-04-16

                                    imo has chosen to make 2021 a year of action for seafarers, who are facing unprecedented hardship due to the covid-19 pandemic, despite their vital role as key workers for global supply chains. the world maritime theme for 2021, ""seafarers: at the core of shipping's future"" seeks to increase the visibility of seafarers by drawing attention to the invaluable role they play now and will continue to play in the future. the covid-19 pandemic has placed extraordinary demands on seafarers, with hundreds of thousands of men and women stranded on ships for months beyond their original contracts, unable to be repatriated due to national travel restrictions. a similar number of seafarers are unable to join ships and earn a living. this crew change crisis, which has been ongoing for nearly a year, is a humanitarian emergency that threatens the safety of shipping.launching the world maritime theme on 16 february, imo secretary-general kitack lim said more governments must step up to end the crew change crisis. ""we all must do better to support our brave professionals who continue to deliver global trade. the dedication and professionalism of more than one and a half million seafarers worldwide deserve our great admiration and gratitude – but most importantly, immediate action,"" mr lim said.""a first step would be for all countries to designate seafarers as key workers, as outlined in the united nations general assembly resolution adopted in december,"" mr lim added, referring to the unga resolution on international cooperation to address challenges faced by seafarers as a result of the covid-19 pandemic to support global supply chains. (the full message including video can be downloaded and viewed here)key worker designation is crucial to ensure seafarers can travel to and from ships and will facilitate access to priority vaccination. to date, 55 imo member states and two associate members have designated seafarers as key workers (click here for the full list).throughout the year, the world maritime theme will also put the spotlight on other issues related to the human element of shipping, including the safety and security of life on board ships, seafarers' well-being, and the importance of ensuring an appropriately trained and qualified workforce, ready to meet the challenges and opportunities of digitalization and automation. the focus on seafarers is also in line with the work carried out by the organization, since the beginning of the pandemic and before. ""at imo, seafarers have always been at the centre of all our work – be it in the area of safety, maritime security, or environmental protection,"" imo secretary-general said.the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic will be discussed by the sub-committee on human element, training and watchkeeping (htw), which is taking place this week (15-19 february).making voices of seafarers heardas part of its efforts to put seafarers at the heart of discussions, imo is launching a series of profiles in which seafarers express their views on their work and the future of shipping.  in the first profile, chief engineer matt forster (united kingdom) highlighted the importance of making seafarers more visible, particularly in the context of the crew change crisis.""we're the pillars of the supply chains around the world. trade is coming by sea. but because people are not aware of us, we don't get the support we need. we want people to know that it is the men and women within our industry that provide them with everything they need for their day-to-day lives. it's not for praise, it's to assist us in being recognised, to help us to get home, to see our families, to be with our loved ones, and to continue this supply chain going,"" mr forster said. further profiles will be published throughout the year. visit the imo's world maritime theme 2021 page here. seafarers are vital to supply chains, delivering 80% of global trade, including food, medicine and energy. the world maritime theme for 2021, ""seafarers: at the core of shipping's future"", will address many of the issues confronting the maritime workforce, including recruitment and retention of seafarers, diversity, training, environment protection and digitalisation of shipping.  the 2021 theme is also a continuation of, and is directly linked to the 2020 theme ""sustainable shipping for a sustainable planet"" to highlight the role that seafarers will play in ensuring the sustainable future for shipping.",2021-04-16

                                forty-eight states signed the torremolinos declaration, publicly indicating their determination to ensure that the 2012 cape town agreement on fishing vessel safety will enter into force by the tenth anniversary of its adoption (11 october 2022).
                                    forty-eight states sign public declaration to indicate their determination to bring the 2012 cape town agreement on fishing vessel safety into force. the declaration was signed during a ministerial conference held in torremolinos, spain.some 120 states, 70 ministerial-level representatives, 30 international organizations and 500 delegates attended the torremolinos ministerial conference on fishing vessel safety and illegal, unreported and unregulated (iuu) fishing (21-23 october), in one of the largest fishing vessel conferences held in the history of the international maritime organization (imo). a global regime to create much-needed safety standards for fishing vessels has moved a significant step closer following the imo-led international ministerial conference, organized in conjunction with spain, the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) and the pew charitable trusts.during the conference (21-23 october), nearly 50 states signed the torremolinos declaration, publicly indicating their determination to ratify the agreement by the target date of 11 october 2022 (tenth anniversary of the adoption of the agreement). the cape town agreement includes mandatory safety measures for fishing vessels of 24 m in length and over. it covers key parameters such as stability and associated seaworthiness, machinery and electrical installations, life-saving appliances, communications equipment, fire protection and fishing vessel construction. although adopted in 2012, it will only enter into force after at least 22 states, with an aggregate 3,600 fishing vessels of 24 m in length and over, have expressed their consent to be bound by it.when it does, it will improve the safety of life at sea for hundreds of thousands of fishers worldwide, who currently do not benefit from a global mandatory regime for fishing vessel safety. it is also seen as key tool in combating illegal, unregulated and unreported (iuu) fishing. speaking at the close of the conference, which adopted the ""torremolinos statement on the cape town agreement of 2012, relating to fishing vessel safety, and combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing"", imo secretary-general kitack lim noted that imo had once again returned to torremolinos to finish the endeavours started more than 40 years ago, when the first global treaty to address safety of fishing vessels was adopted in torremolinos in 1977 (it did not enter into force).  ""in 2019, with this conference, we now have a broader consensus on the urgent need for the cape town agreement to enter into force, as a significant contribution to the long-term sustainability of the fishing industry,"" mr. lim said. ""this work must now continue, in a pro-active and cooperative manner, to bring the agreement into force as soon as possible, so that fishers around the world can enjoy the safety and welfare benefits,"" mr. lim said.the first international treaty on fishing vessel safety was adopted by imo in torremolinos in 1977, with a follow-up protocol adopted in 1993. but their lack of entry into force has meant that fishers are not yet protected by a global, mandatory treaty – unlike cargo and passenger ships which are covered by international treaties for safety of life at sea and environmental protection, which have wide acceptance and have been in force for many decades. the cape town agreement, adopted in 2012, builds on the earlier treaties and will provide the global regime needed for safety of fishing vessels, alongside the international convention on standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for fishing vessel personnel, 1995 (1995 stcw-f convention), which is already in forceno time to loseministers and organizations alike highlighted the importance of the cape town agreement for safety, for combating iuu fishing, and for the sustainable development of an industry which feeds millions of people.   imo secretary-general lim ended the conference with a key message for states. ""you are the leaders who can now push this cause forward, in collaboration with relevant national bodies, other states and international organizations, to bring this process to a successful conclusion. that is, to bring into force the final piece of the international regulatory framework for fishing, the cape town agreement,"" mr. lim said. ""there is no time to lose.  if the fishing sector remains insufficiently regulated, fishing-related activities will continue to cause more fatalities; pollute our oceans; place sar services at risk; and harm developing states affected by illegal fishing activities,"" mr. lim said. the cape town agreementthe cape town agreement treaty will enter into force 12 months after at least 22 states, with an aggregate 3,600 fishing vessels of 24 m in length and over have expressed their consent to be bound by it. with two accessions made during the conference, by cook islands and sao tome and principe, 13 countries have now ratified the cape town agreement: belgium, congo, cook islands, denmark, france, germany, iceland, netherlands, norway, saint kitts and nevis, sao tome and principe, south africa and spain.torremolinos declarationas well as taking action to ensure entry into force, states signing the torremolinos declaration, pledged to promote the agreement, recognizing that the ultimate effectiveness of the instrument depends upon the widespread support of states, in their capacities as flag states, port states and coastal states. they also denounced the proliferation of iuu fishing, recognizing that international safety standards for fishing vessels will provide port states with a mandatory instrument to carry out safety inspections of fishing vessels, thereby increasing control and transparency of fishing activities.forty-eight countries have so far signed the declaration: argentina, bangladesh, belgium, belize, central african republic, chile, china, congo (republic of), cook islands, costa rica, croatia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, ecuador, fiji, finland, france, gabon, germany, ghana, guinea (republic of), guinea bissau, iceland, indonesia, ireland, kiribati, lebanon, liberia, marshall islands, mozambique, namibia, netherlands, new zealand, nicaragua, nigeria, norway, panama, papua new guinea, peru, republic of korea, sao tome and principe, sierra leone, south africa, spain, togo, uganda, united kingdom, vanuatu. the declaration is open for further signatures until 21 october 2020.conference resolutions and torremolinos statementthe conference adopted two resolutions. (download resolutions)conference resolution 1 adopted the torremolinos statement on the cape town agreement of 2012 and combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. the statement highlights the importance of the cape town agreement and the work on combating iuu fishing. it calls on states to ratify the cape town agreement; urges states to take actions to prevent deter and eliminate iuu fishing; encourage states to ratify and promote the stcw-f convention on training of fishing vessel personnel; calls upon fao, ilo, imo to continue to work together in the fishing sector; and requests imo to continue to provide technical assistance to states who request it in order to accede to and implement the cape town agreement. the second resolution expresses appreciation to spain for hosting the conference. addressing the challenges for safe and legal fishinga series of panel discussions during the conference provided an opportunity for expert speakers to discuss and share best practice in a number of key areas, including environmental protection; stopping iuu fishing; reducing risk and protecting search and rescue services; responsible fishing schemes; working conditions; and marine debris from fishing vessels. presentations can be downloaded here.  along with the cape town agreement and the stcw-f convention, two other key treaties address fishing vessels and contribute to the fight against iuu fishing. they are: ilo's work in fishing convention 2007 (convention no. 188), which entered into force on 16 november 2017 and sets minimum requirements for work on board including hours of rest, food, minimum age and repatriation; and fao's agreement on port state measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (psma), 2009, which entered into force in 2016 and seeks to prevent, deter and eliminate iuu fishing through the adoption and implementation of effective port state measures. torremolinos conferencethe conference, hosted by imo and the government of spain, brought together some 120 states, 70 ministerial-level representatives, 30 international organizations and 500 delegates.the torremolinos conference was held with the kind support of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) and the pew charitable trusts. the opening session of the conference was addressed by the un special envoy for the oceans, peter thomson, and by ministers from spain, as well as by fao and unctad. the president of the ministerial segment was spain's secretary-general of transport, ms. maría josé rallo del olmo. read more here. women in fisheriesa side event on women in fisheries highlighted the role of women in fisheries and the need for greater visibility and recognition. see more here. joint working group on iuu fishing 23-25 october the conference is being followed by a meeting of the joint fao/ilo/imo working group on iuu fishing (23-25 october).",2021-04-16

                                <U+200B>from 1 january 2020 the global upper limit on the sulphur content of ships' fuel oil will be reduced to 0.50% (from 3.50%). known as ""imo 2020"", the reduced limit is mandatory for all ships operating outside certain designated emission control areas*, where the limit is already 0.10%.
                                    global limit on sulphur in ships' fuel oil reduced from 01 january 2020a global regulation that will substantially reduce harmful sulphur oxide (sox) emissions from ships comes into effect from 1 january 2020, bringing significant benefits for both human health and the environment.  from 1 january 2020 the global upper limit on the sulphur content of ships' fuel oil will be reduced to 0.50% (from 3.50%). known as ""imo 2020"", the reduced limit is mandatory for all ships operating outside certain designated emission control areas*, where the limit is already 0.10%.the new limit will mean a 77% drop in overall sox emissions from ships, equivalent to an annual reduction of approximately 8.5 million metric tonnes of sox. particulate matter - tiny harmful particles which form when fuel is burnt – will also be reduced. as a result, reductions in stroke, asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases are expected. cutting sulphur emissions from ships will also help prevent acid rain and ocean acidification, benefitting crops, forests and aquatic species.the new limit is part of the international convention for the prevention of pollution form ships (marpol), a key environmental treaty under the auspices of the international maritime organization (imo) – the united nations specialized agency responsible for developing and adopting standards for preventing pollution from ships, as well as shipping safety and efficiency, and maritime security.  the decision to cut the global limit for sulphur in ships fuel oil to 0.50% was made in 2008 and confirmed again in october 2016. an immense amount of preparatory work has been undertaken by imo and industry stakeholders to ensure the changeover goes smoothly. imo has issued a series of guidelines to help the shipping sector and its member states to prepare, including ship implementation planning guidance (addressing issues such as risk assessment for new fuels and tank cleaning) and port state control guidelines. imo secretary-general kitack lim said, ""for the past three years, imo member states, the shipping industry and fuel oil suppliers have been working tirelessly to prepare for this major change in the sulphur content of ships' fuel oil. i am confident that the benefits will soon be felt and that implementation will be smooth."" he added, ""i am very appreciative of all the efforts made by refineries, shipowners, seafarers, industry organizations and others in preparing for this hugely important change - which will have significant positive benefits for human health and the environment."" to support smooth implementation, the imo secretariat has set up a dedicated hotline email address for any queries from member states and the shipping industry as the regulation comes into effect. to supply compliant fuel oil, refineries may blend fuel oils with a higher and lower sulphur content. additives may be used to enhance other properties, such as lubricity. ships may also use different fuels, with low or even zero sulphur - for example, liquefied natural gas, or biofuels. however, mixture and co-mingling of different fuels are not recommended on board the ship . shipowners should refer to the relevant  international standardization organization (iso) standards (iso 8217 and iso/pas 23263:2019). shipowners should test compatibility, stability and other relevant characters of compliant fuels to be used. limiting air pollutants by installing exhaust gas cleaning systems, also known as ""scrubbers"", is accepted if flag states approve as an alternative means to meet the sulphur limit requirement. scrubbers remove sulphur oxides from the ship's engine and boiler exhaust gases, enabling ships fitted with them to continue to use heavy fuel oil, in accordance with imo guidelines. *baltic sea; north sea; north american area; united states caribbean sea arearesourcesimo web page on sulphur 2020 answers frequently asked questions and includes an imo leaflet (download here) which outlines the requirement, answers the most frequently asked questions about the rule and provides a list of the imo instruments supporting implementation, best practice guidance, port state control and sampling guidelines and others.imo has published a compilation of all related guidance, best practices and so on, as a single imo publication (hard copy and electronic formats).

                                    on 1 january 2020, new reduced limits on sulphur in fuel oil brought about a 70% cut in total sulphur oxide emissions from shipping, ushering in a new era of cleaner air in ports and coastal areas by using less polluting fuels. one year on, indications are that the transition has been extremely smooth, a testament to the preparations of all stakeholders prior to the new rules entering into force.  the upper limit of the sulphur content of ships' fuel oil was reduced to 0.5% (from 3.5% previously) - under the so-called ""imo 2020"" regulation prescribed in the marpol convention. this significantly reduces the amount of sulphur oxide emanating from ships.""through 2020, just 55 cases of 0.50% compliant fuel being unavailable had been reported in imo's global integrated shipping information system (gisis),"" said roel hoenders, head of air pollution and energy efficiency at imo (see fonar reports section below). ""given that more than 60,000 ships plied the world's oceans in trade last year, this was a remarkably low percentage of ships encountering difficulty in obtaining compliant fuel. we had a great deal of preparation during 2019 and before, from all stakeholders and all indications are that there have been no significant issues with supply of low sulphur fuel oil.""even during the covid-19 pandemic, cargo-carrying ships have continued to deliver goods and commodities, including essential foods and medicines, around the world and the introduction and implementation of imo 2020 did not cause any disruptions in trade.   compliant fuels include very low sulphur fuel oil (vlsfo) and marine gas oil (mgo). some ships limit their air pollutants by installing exhaust gas cleaning systems, also known as ""scrubbers"". this is accepted  under the marpol convention as an alternative means to meet the sulphur limit requirement. around 3,100 systems have formally been reported to imo as an approved ""equivalent method"" by administrations (flag states), by the end of 2020.ships can also have engines which are able to use different fuels, which may contain low or zero sulphur, such as liquefied natural gas or biofuels.the majority of ships trading worldwide switched from using heavy fuel oil (hfo) to using vlsfo. generally speaking, these are new blends of fuel oil, produced by refineries to meet the new limit, in accordance with imo guidance and iso standards. guidance issued by imo on dealing with the new fuel blends in advance of the new requirement addressed implications of switching to vlsfo, including assessing and managing risks and highlighting potential safety risks, so that the risks can be mitigated. through 2020, and into 2021 to date, imo has not received any reports of safety issues linked to vlsfo. nonetheless, during 2020, an imo correspondence group considered fuel oil safety issues in general and the need for further mandatory requirements to ensure fuel oil supplied meets the required standards and quality. the report of the group (msc 102/6) is available on imodocs  and will be discussed at the next session of imo's maritime safety committee (msc), msc 103 in may 2021. prior to that, the eighth session of the sub-committee on prevention of pollution from ships (ppr 8), scheduled to meet remotely from 22 to 26 march 2021, will further consider vlsfo fuel quality issues, including possible effects on black carbon emissions.fuel oil quality requirementsprovisions in regulation 18 of annex vi of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships (marpol) regulate fuel oil quality. the international convention for the safety of life at sea (solas) covers issues such as flashpoint (solas regulation ii- 2/4.2.1).apart from the requirements in marpol annex vi and solas, vlsfo is required to meet iso standard 8217 as well as iso publicly available specification (pas) 23263, providing guidance as to the application of the existing iso 8217 marine fuel standard to 0.50% sulphur limit compliant fuel oils. these measures and standards are designed to ensure ships' safety and the protection of the marine environment and oceans.fonar reportsfonar reports can be viewed on imo's global integrated shipping information system (gisis), under regulation 18.2.5 notifications. in the gisis module, the imo secretariat has examined the records that have selected the check-box for fuel oil ""not exceeding 0.50% m/m (in effect 1 january 2020)"". individual records need to be viewed to access this information.read more:  https://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/hottopics/pages/sulphur-2020.aspx",2021-04-16

                                    two brazilian pilots who averted an environmental disaster and an officer from the philippines who ensured the survival of fellow passengers from a sinking vessel while off-duty will receive the 2020 imo award for exceptional bravery at sea.meeting for its 124th session (12-14 october), the imo council endorsed the recommendation from a panel of judges, agreeing that two nominations were worthy of the highest recognition this year. preventing an environmental disaster in brazilthe 2020 imo award for exceptional bravery at sea will be awarded to mr. marcio santos teixeira and mr. fabio rodrigues alves de abreu, members of the são paulo pilots, for averting a major oil spill event at the terminal almirante barroso in são sebastião port. they were nominated by brazil for their decisiveness, professionalism and ship-handling expertise in safely maneuvering two oil tankers that had gone adrift during a ship-to-ship operation, in extreme weather conditions.on 28 april 2019, the two pilots were alerted that the mooring lines of two tankers berthed in a ship-to-ship operation were breaking, due to extreme wind gusts of up to 70 knots. the situation was critical, with the vessels drifting while still connected by oil hoses and mooring lines. despite poor visibility caused by heavy rain and high waves, the two pilots managed to board tankers rio 2016 and milton santos. with a pilot on each vessel, the rio 2016 was navigated towards anchoring area, with the milton santos towed alongside, at a maximum speed of 1.5 knots. meanwhile, the pilots had to coordinate the challenging evacuation of a seriously injured crew member, who sadly later passed away. after the wind speed decreased and the anchor of the rio 2016 was dropped, the vessels were disconnected from each other and the two pilots skillfully manoeuvred the milton santos away from the rio 2016. after more than five tense hours, the milton santos finally dropped her anchor. the courageous actions of pilot teixeira and pilot abreu helped ensure more lives were not lost and prevented a major marine pollution incident and serious damage to pier structures and oil facilities.saving fellow passengers from a sinking vesselthe 2020 imo award for exceptional bravery at sea will  also be awarded to petty officer second class ralph ofalla barajan of the philippine coast guard, for helping to save the lives of all 62 people onboard the sinking passenger vessel siargao princess, on whichhe  was also a passenger. he was nominated by the philippines for his leadership and determination, even while he was off duty.on the morning of 7 november 2019, po2 barajan was alerted by the battering of big waves and screams from other passengers. the cargo hold was quickly flooding, affecting the vessel's stability. after calling the coast guard to request immediate assistance, petty officer barajan, took charge of the situation and provided assistance and instructions to both passengers and crew members to grab life jackets, transfer to the other side of the ship and prepare for evacuation. after he calmly but firmly persuaded the captain to declare the ""abandon ship"" call, he assisted all passengers to jump off the vessel, making sure that no one was left behind. the siargao princess sank less than 10 minutes later. while floating on the water, petty officer barajan tied the life jackets of passengers and crew members in groups for their own safety, and to facilitate the search and rescue operations by the coast guard, who arrived more than an hour later.his courage and decisiveness ensured the survival of all 62 lives onboard, as well as contributing to the successful rescue by the philippines coast guard. imo awards ceremonythe awards will be presented at an awards ceremony to be scheduled by the secretary-general. about the imo award for exceptional bravery at seathis annual award was established by the organization to provide international recognition for those who, at the risk of losing their own life, perform acts of exceptional bravery, displaying outstanding courage in attempting to save life at sea or in attempting to prevent or mitigate damage to the marine environment. such acts of bravery may also involve extraordinary skills in very difficult conditions or any other display of outstanding courage.this year a total of 31 nominations were been submitted by 18 member states and two non-governmental organizations in consultative status with imo. the nominations were examined by an assessment panel which includes representatives of the international chamber of shipping (ics), the international maritime pilots' association (impa), the international federation of shipmasters' associations (ifsma), the international salvage union (isu), the international maritime rescue federation (imrf) and the international transport workers' federation (itf).the assessment panel

                                    draft amendments to the marpol convention would require ships to combine a technical and an operational approach to reduce their carbon intensity. 
                                
                                <U+200B>the marine environment protection committee (mepc) is meeting in virtual session 16-20 november 2020
                                    draft new mandatory regulations  to cut the carbon intensity of existing ships have been approved by the international maritime organization (imo) marine environment protection committee (mepc).  this builds on current mandatory energy efficiency requirements to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.  the mepc also agreed the  terms of reference for assessing the possible impacts on states, paying particular attention to the needs of developing countries, in particular small island developing states (sids) and least developed countries (ldcs).   the draft amendments to the marpol convention would require ships to combine a technical and an operational approach to reduce their carbon intensity. this is in line with the ambition of the initial imo ghg strategy, which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40% by 2030, compared to 2008. the amendments were developed by the seventh session of the intersessional working group on reduction of ghg emissions from ships (iswg-ghg 7), held as a remote meeting 19-23 october 2020.   the draft amendments will now be put forward for formal adoption at mepc 76 session, to be held during 2021.   imo secretary-general kitack lim, said, “considerable further work on the implementation of the measures is still ahead of us, but i am confident that, the imo spirit of cooperation, shown during the past years, will enable swift progress with the development of technical guidelines and a carbon intensity code as well as the essential further work on the comprehensive assessment of impacts of the measures on developing countries, sids and ldcs. i express my gratitude to all member states that have indicated a commitment to supporting these efforts.” he said the approved amendments were important building blocks without which future discussions on mid and long-term measures will not be possible. the progress in developing the short-term measures follows the timeline as set out in the initial imo ghg strategy. the strategy proposed that short-term measures should be those measures finalized and agreed by the committee between 2018 and 2023.  in more detail:   draft marpol amendments  the draft amendments would add further requirements to the energy efficiency measures in marpol annex vi chapter 4.  current requirements are based on the energy efficiency design index (eedi), for new build ships, which means they have to be built and designed to be more energy efficient than the baseline; and the mandatory ship energy efficiency management plan (seemp), for all ships. the seemp provides for ship operators to have in place a plan to improve energy efficiency through a variety of ship specific measures.  the draft amendments build on these measures by bringing in requirements to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and set the required attainment values. the goal is to reduce the carbon intensity of international shipping, working towards the levels of ambition set out in the initial imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships.  the set of amendments includes: the technical requirement to reduce carbon intensity, based on a new energy efficiency existing ship index (eexi); and the operational carbon intensity reduction requirements, based on a new operational carbon intensity indicator (cii).   the dual approach aims to address both technical (how the ship is retrofitted and equipped) and operational measures (how the ship operates).  attained and required energy efficiency existing ship index (eexi)  the attained energy efficiency existing ship index (eexi) is required to be calculated for ships of 400 gt and above, in accordance with the different values set for ship types and size categories. this indicates the energy efficiency of the ship compared to a baseline.   ships are required to meet a specific required energy efficiency existing ship index (eexi), which is based on a required reduction factor (expressed as a percentage relative to the eedi baseline).   annual operational carbon intensity indicator (cii) and cii rating  the draft amendments are for ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above (the ships already subject to the requirement for data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships) to have determined their required annual operational carbon intensity indicator (cii). the cii determines the annual reduction factor needed to ensure continuous improvement of the ship’s operational carbon intensity within a specific rating level.  the actual annual operational cii achieved (attained annual operational cii) would be required to be documented and verified against the required annual operational cii. this would enable the operational carbon intensity rating to be determined.  the rating would be given on a scale - operational carbon intensity rating a, b, c, d or e - indicating a major superior, minor superior, moderate, minor inferior, or inferior performance level. the performance level would be recorded in the ship’s ship energy efficiency management plan (seemp).  a ship rated d for three consecutive years, or e, would have to submit a corrective action plan, to show how the required index (c or above) would be achieved.  administrations, port authorities and other stakeholders as appropriate, are encouraged to provide incentives to ships rated as a or b.  review mechanism  the draft amendments would require the imo to review the effectiveness of the implementation of the cii and eexi requirements, by 1 january 2026 at the latest, and, if necessary, develop and adopt further amendments.    next steps  the draft amendments can now be adopted at the mepc 76 session, to be held during 2021.   the marpol treaty requires draft amendments to be circulated for a minimum six months before adoption, and they can enter into force after a minimum 16 months following adoption. the amendment procedures are set out in the treaty itself.   impact assessment  the comprehensive impact assessment will be based on the procedure for assessing impacts on states of candidate measures, adopted in 2019, which says a comprehensive impact assessment should provide a detailed qualitative and/or quantitative assessment of specific negative impacts on states, and  be evidence-based and should take into account, as appropriate, analysis tools and models, such as, cost-effectiveness analysis tools, e.g. maritime transport cost models, trade flows models, impact on gross domestic product (gdp); updated marginal abatement cost curves (maccs); and economic trade models, transport models and combined trade-transport models.   the final comprehensive impact assessment of the short-term combined measure should be submitted to mepc 76. based on this, a possible framework for reviewing impacts on states of the measure adopted, and addressing disproportionately negative impacts on states, as appropriate, would be considered.  initial imo ghg strategy  the initial imo ghg strategy, adopted in 2018, sets ambitious targets to halve ghg emission from ships by 2050, compared to 2008, and reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40% by 2030 compared to 2008. the strategy lists a number of candidate measures which could also be considered to further reduce emissions and help achieve the targets in the strategy, in particular 40% reduction of carbon intensity from shipping by 2030. short-term measures could be measures finalized and agreed by the committee between 2018 and 2023, although in aiming for early action, priority should be given to develop potential early measures with a view to achieving further reduction of ghg emissions from international shipping before 2023. dates of entry into force and when the measure can effectively start to reduce ghg emissions would be defined for each measure individually. a procedure for assessing the impact on states of a measure has been approved.",2021-04-16

                                <U+200B>online surveys are part of imo study which aims to provide a comprehensive review of the technical standards and approval testing procedures in the guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (g8).
                                    all stakeholders involved in the testing, approval, fitting and operation of ballast water management systems (bwms) are being invited to complete online surveys, as a part of an international maritime organization (imo) study to assess the implementation of the bwms approval guidelines and the performance of type-approved systems.  
 the study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the technical standards and approval testing procedures in the guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (g8), initiated by imo's marine environment protection committee (mepc) at its 67th session in october 2014. the intention is to address concerns that the testing regime for approval of bwms needs to be sufficiently robust and consistent, so that approved systems will meet the standards set out in the international convention for the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments, 2004 (bwm convention). 
 
the surveys can be accessed at sites.google.com/a/wmu.se/d2study/ and will remain open until 1 june 2015. the following are invited to participate: administrations and associated agencies; test facilities, organizations and independent experts; bwms developers, manufacturers and vendors; classification societies; ship owners and operators; flag state and port state control inspectors; and other relevant experts, consultants or organizations. 
 
the study is being carried out by the imo secretariat in partnership with the world maritime university (wmu) and its outcome will be reported to mepc 69 in spring 2016. 
 
the bwm convention addresses the problem of aquatic organisms and pathogens being released into non-native environments after being transported around the world in ships' ballast water. such organisms may survive and out-compete native species, becoming invasive and causing a great deal of damage to the local ecosystem, resources, infrastructure, as well as potentially to human health. the bwm convention requires the management of ballast water in order to prevent the transfer of such microorganisms or species.
 
the bwm convention will enter into force 12 months after ratification by 30 states which collectively represent 35 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage. the number of ratifying states (44) is already sufficient but, at 32.86 per cent, their collective share of world merchant shipping tonnage is not quite sufficient to trigger entry into force. 
 
note: the study on the implementation of the ballast water performance standard described in regulation d-2 of the bwm convention is fact-based and will focus on collecting, synthesizing and analysing data and verifiable information and documentation. it involves two ""tracks"" to facilitate and optimize the collection of data: (1) similarities/differences in testing and certification; and (2) bwms operational performance.
 
the two online surveys can be accessed at https://sites.google.com/a/wmu.se/d2study/. the surveys will remain open until 1 june 2015. queries can be addressed to: d2study@wmu.se.

   the 2020 day of the seafarer pays tribute to unsung heroes of the covid-19 pandemic: the seafarers who continue to carry essential goods despite facing tremendous challenges, including being stranded on board. organised by imo, this year's campaign calls on governments to take action and formally recognise seafarers as key workers.on 25 june every year, the day of the seafarer turns the spotlight on the contribution seafarers make to world trade. with the global fight against the covid-19 pandemic, the services they provide are more important than ever. seafarers play an essential role in maintaining the flow of vital goods, such as food, fuels and medical supplies, that people, everywhere, need. this is why the 2020 campaign is calling on imo member states to recognize seafarers as key workers - and to provide them with the support, assistance and travel options open to all key workers during the pandemic.   the campaign also seeks to raise awareness of the sacrifice of seafarers and the issues they face. travel restrictions have left hundreds of thousands of seafarers stranded at sea, unsure when they will be able to return home. many are fatigued and weary because their time at sea has been extended for months beyond the maximum stipulated in international conventions.in his day of the seafarer message, imo secretary-general kitack lim highlighted the unique and essential work of seafarers, who deliver 80% of global trade by volume. he praised the dedication, professionalism and resilience of seafarers, at a time when many are unable to be repatriated or replaced by relief crews. the secretary-general also emphasised the difficulties faced by seafarers, including denial of shore leave, difficulties in accessing medical care and, in some cases, the lack of personal protective equipment. ""despite all these challenges, seafarers have stayed on the job, 24/7"", mr. lim said.   ""just like other key workers, seafarers are on the front line in this global fight. they deserve our thanks. but they also need – and deserve – quick and decisive humanitarian action from governments everywhere, not just during the pandemic, but at all times"", mr. lim insisted.mr. lim has written to all imo member states, urging them to recognize all seafarers as ""key workers"". 
   this call was echoed by united nations secretary-general antónio guterres who thanked and saluted seafarers everywhere for their work, and  urged all countries in the world to honour seafarers by
recognizing them as key workers and providing the necessary travel assistance to
ensure safe crew changeovers and repatriations (download message from un secretary-general here.).
   social media campaignthe day of the seafarer campaign is centred on social media. the 2020 hashtag is: #seafarersarekeyworkersthis hashtag can be used by anyone engaging in the campaign to pay tribute to seafarers and thank them for their important role in these unprecedented  times. seafarers themselves can use it to showcase their own position at the front line of this global crisis and share their experience with the rest of the world. shipping companies and port organizations are also invited to show their appreciation for seafarers.
   about the day of the seafarerthe day of the seafarer is celebrated every year on 25 june. the day celebrates and recognizes the unique contribution made by seafarers from all over the world to international seaborne trade, the world economy and civil society. 2020 marks the 10th edition of the day of the seafarer. download visuals and more

                                    30 countries join global initiative to tackle marine litter
                                
                                
                                    countries from across the oceans team up to tackle marine plastic litter under the ambitious glolitter partnerships project.
                                
                                <U+200B><U+200B>plastic litter has devastating effects on our oceans, marine life and human health. it also has measurable impacts on the fishing and shipping industries.  
                                    a major international project that will help reduce marine plastic litter from maritime transport and fishing sectors is up for a successful start, after getting 30 countries on board. five regions will be represented in this global effort: asia, africa, the caribbean, latin america and the pacific. the glolitter partnerships project is implemented by the international maritime organization (imo) and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), with initial funding from the government of norway via the norwegian agency for development cooperation (norad). the project aims to help the maritime transport and fishing sectors move towards a low-plastics future. to achieve this goal, this initiative will assist developing countries to apply best practices for prevention, reduction and control of marine plastic litter from those sectors.  plastic litter has devastating effects on our oceans, marine life and human health. it also has measurable impacts on the fishing and shipping industries.  discarded fishing gear can pose a serious risk to fishers as the nets or lines can become entangled in boat propellers or cause engine damage. there is also an economic impact when fishers or fisheries lose their gear or fish species are caught in discarded gear. lost containers might also pose a collision hazard for ships. reducing and preventing marine plastic litter is vital to safeguard coastal and global marine resources. jose matheickal, chief, imo department for partnerships and projects, welcomed the countries on board: “marine litter is a scourge on the oceans and on the planet. i am delighted that we have 30 countries committed to joining this initiative and working with imo and fao to address this growing issue. their experience and the development of best practices will serve as a model throughout the world and i look forward to seeing results as the project moves ahead,” mr. matheickal said.  “plastic litter has a devastating impact on marine life and human health,” said manuel barange, fao’s director of fisheries and aquaculture.  “this initiative is an important step in tackling the issue and will help protect the ecosystem as well as the livelihoods of those who depend on the ocean.” lead and partnering countries ten countries have been confirmed as lead partnering countries (lpcs) and a further twenty countries have been selected as partnering countries (pcs) of the glolitter project.  lpcs will take lead roles in their respective regions to champion national actions in the context of supporting the imo action plan on marine litter and the fao voluntary guidelines for the marking of fishing gear. the lpcs and pcs will work together, via a twinning working arrangement, to build regional support for the project. the 10 lead partnering countries are: brazil, costa rica, cote d’ivoire, india, indonesia, jamaica, kenya, madagascar, nigeria and vanuatu. the 20 partnering countries are: argentina, cabo verde, columbia, ecuador, gambia, mozambique, nicaragua, panama, peru, philippines, senegal, sri lanka, solomon islands, sudan, united republic of tanzania, thailand, timor-leste, togo, tonga and viet nam. tangible global action in the coming months, the project coordination units at imo and fao will work with lpcs to develop national work plans tailored to the needs of each country, provide necessary technical assistance and training to implement those plans, and facilitate twinning arrangements between lpcs and pcs.  the glolitter project will equip the partner countries with knowledge and tools that will include guidance documents, training material and methodologies to help enforce existing regulations. these include imo's international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships (marpol) annex v regulations on the prevention of pollution by garbage, which prohibits the discharge of plastics (including fishing gear) into the sea from ships. another treaty regime, the imo london convention/london protocol, regulates the dumping of wastes from ships, permitting only certain types of non-harmful waste to be dumped.  the project will also promote compliance with relevant fao instruments, including the voluntary guidelines for the marking of fishing gear, and enhance existing initiatives, such as the global ghost gear initiative (gggi). the project will also look at the the availability  and adequacy port reception facilities and their connectivity to national waste management systems and develop a “model port waste management plan” including the concept of the circular economy, to be piloted by selected ports from participating countries.  the project will address how to deal with abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear. there will be pilot initiatives with women-led organizations active in fisheries to reduce the use of plastic in fisheries, fish processing/marketing, and to collect plastic for recycling. the project will facilitate the establishment of public-private partnerships to spur the development of cost-effective management solutions for marine plastic litter, including examining how to decrease the use of plastics in these industries and looking at opportunities to re-use and recycle plastics. this work to reduce plastic litter is in line with imo's action plan to address marine plastic litter from ships.  materials developed by the project will be made available on the glolitter webpage. ___________ for further information please contact: imo - the international maritime organization - is the united nations specialized agency with responsibility for the safety

                                <U+200B>the initial ghg strategy was adopted by imo’s marine environment protection committee (mepc), during its 72nd session at imo headquarters in london, united kingdom. the meeting was attended by more than 100 imo member states.  
                                    nations meeting at the united nations international maritime organization (imo) in london have adopted an initial strategy on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships, setting out a vision to reduce ghg emissions from international shipping and phase them out, as soon as possible in this century.  the vision confirms imo’s commitment to reducing ghg emissions from international shipping and, as a matter of urgency, to phasing them out as soon as possible.more specifically, under the identified “levels of ambition”, the initial strategy envisages for the first time a reduction in total ghg emissions from international shipping which, it says, should peak as soon as possible and to reduce the total annual ghg emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008, while, at the same time, pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely.the strategy includes a specific reference to “a pathway of co2 emissions reduction consistent with the paris agreement temperature goals”.the initial strategy was adopted by imo’s marine environment protection committee (mepc), during its 72nd session at imo headquarters in london, united kingdom. the meeting was attended by more than 100 imo member states.  the initial strategy represents a framework for member states, setting out the future vision for international shipping, the levels of ambition to reduce ghg emissions and guiding principles; and includes candidate short-, mid- and long-term further measures with possible timelines and their impacts on states. the strategy also identifies barriers and supportive measures including capacity building, technical cooperation and research and development (r&d).imo secretary-general kitack lim said the adoption of the strategy was another successful illustration of the renowned imo spirit of cooperation and would allow future imo work on climate change to be rooted in a solid basis.he told delegates, “i encourage you to continue your work through the newly adopted initial ghg strategy which is designed as a platform for future actions. i am confident in relying on your ability to relentlessly continue your efforts and develop further actions that will soon contribute to reducing ghg emissions from ships.” according to the “roadmap” approved by imo member states in 2016, the initial strategy is due to be revised by 2023.continuing the momentum of work on this issue, the committee agreed to hold the fourth intersessional meeting of the working group on reduction of ghg emissions from ships later in the year. this working group will be tasked with developing a programme of follow-up actions to the initial strategy; further considering how to progress reduction of ghg emissions from ships in order to advise the committee; and reporting to the next session of the mepc (mepc 73), which meets 22-26 october 2018. imo has already adopted global mandatory measures to address the reduction in ghg emissions from ships. imo is also executing global technical cooperation projects to support the capacity of states, particularly developing states to implement and support energy efficiency in the shipping sector. ****initial imo strategy on the reduction of ghg emissions from shipsthe initial strategy includes the following:vision:    imo remains committed to reducing ghg emissions from international shipping and, as a matter of urgency, aims to phase them out as soon as possible in this century.levels of ambitionthe initial strategy identifies levels of ambition for the international shipping sector noting that technological innovation and the global introduction of alternative fuels and/or energy sources for international shipping will be integral to achieve the overall ambition. reviews should take into account updated emission estimates, emissions reduction options for international shipping, and the reports of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc ). levels of ambition directing the initial strategy are as follows: .1 carbon intensity of the ship to decline through implementation of further phases of the energy efficiency design index (eedi) for new shipsto review with the aim to strengthen the energy efficiency design requirements for ships with the percentage improvement for each phase to be determined for each ship type, as appropriate;.2 carbon intensity of international shipping to decline  to reduce co2 emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70% by 2050, compared to 2008; and.3 ghg emissions from international shipping to peak and decline to peak ghg emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and to reduce the total annual ghg emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 whilst pursuing efforts towards phasing them out as called for in the vision as a point on a pathway of co2 emissions reduction consistent with the paris agreement temperature goals.****note: the paris agreement on climate change was agreed in 2015 by parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) and entered into force in 2016. the paris agreement central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees celsius. the paris agreement does not include international shipping, but imo, as the regulatory body for the industry, is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping.  full text of initial imo

                                    a global network of maritime technology cooperation centres has completed an impressive array of pilot projects over the past three years, helping to drive forward the changes which are required to reduce ghg emissions from shipping. five regional maritime technology cooperation centres (mtccs) have been established under the global maritime technology cooperation centres (gmn) project, which is funded by the european union and implemented by the international maritime organization (imo), the united nations specialized agency with a remit to develop and adopt standards for safer, greener and more sustainable shipping.  between them, the mtccs count 97 participating countries and have been working with 1,179 participating vessels to deliver sets of data which can help inform and support energy efficiency improvement. port energy audits and retrofitting of domestic vessels for better energy efficiency are just two ways in which results are already being seen.more than 160 people from 64 countries recently met for the third annual gmn conference, held together with world maritime university (wmu) at the university's premises in malmö, sweden (8-10 october). during the conference, representatives from the five mtccs reported on their pilot projects which assess a range of measures to help cut emissions in the maritime sector. these range from data collection in accordance with imo marpol requirements, to assessing the impact of local improvements in ports, to reducing emissions in port areas.  ""there is no silver bullet to decarbonise shipping - a basket of measures is needed ranging from framework conditions, standards and innovation to funding and economic incentives,"" said ms. petra doubkova, policy officer of dg move, european commission.   as well as pilot projects, each mtcc is involved in hosting and arranging regional and national workshops and seminars, to raise awareness of imo's energy efficiency measures for ships and to deliver capacity building through training.   ""the mtcc network is a project that unites maritime experts from all over the world in five mtccs, to provide capacity building for climate mitigation in the maritime shipping industry. its work plays an invaluable part in promoting global awareness and in developing global solutions to mitigate ghg emissions from shipping through efficient and sustainable energy use,"" said dr. cleopatra doumbia-henry, wmu president.  ""climate change is a global challenge, and it is only if we work together and share our knowledge and technologies on energy efficiency and renewable energy production, that we can be successful in mitigating climate change,"" dr. doumbia-henry said. successful regional projectsmtcc-caribbean has been coordinating regional efforts in two pilot projects: one to establish a maritime energy efficiency baseline and cost/benefit analysis for different energy efficiency technologies and the other a system for collecting fuel consumption data throughout the caribbean. ""the pilot projects have definitely raised awareness in the caribbean; evidenced, for example, by the fact that now local stakeholders are looking into developing local solutions, such as alternative fuels,"" said captain sukhjit singh, deputy director and technical head of mtcc-caribbean. mtcc asia has been developing a software tool to help ships' crews record fuel consumption and is working on ways of optimising the angle at which ships float in the water (""trim""), to improve their performance; and has also been conducting ship fuel oil consumption data collecting and reporting. fifteen demonstration ships have, to date, provided 68,517 sets of data relating to ship fuel consumption and ship optimum trim. prof. wei ruan, head of mtcc-asia, told the conference that the guidelines on ship trim optimization will be circulated to more than 1000 ocean-going vessels, highlighting the positive local and regional impact of the pilot project.  mtcc latin america has organised several workshops, throughout the region, to help maritime authorities and other stakeholders fulfil their obligations under imo's international regulations on energy efficiency. its pilot projects have focused on examining the barriers and constraints faced by regional ship owners and operators when implementing the imo regulations and on collection of fuel consumption data.   mtcc africa has also been collecting fuel consumption data and has developed standardized e-forms for data collection equipment (tablets), enabling ships' crews to input key parameters, such as fuel type, fuel consumed, engine rating and so on, and then upload this via satellite to a web-based platform - where it can be processed and analysed. by the end of 2018, more than 1000 data sets had been collected. a demonstration pilot project on port energy audits is also being implemented. mtcc pacific has been focusing on uptake of ship energy efficient technologies and operations (including for domestic shipping and on the port side) and on fuel oil consumption data collection and reporting. the positive impact of these efforts in the solomon islands, one of the beneficiary countries, was highlighted in an imo gmn video earlier this year: full energy efficiency and emissions audit in the port of honiara, solomon islands has helped authorities cut emissions considerably. future actionthe gmn project is continuing, through the mtccs, to work with local stakeholders and push forward with raising awareness of energy efficiency in the maritime sector. the mtccs are perfectly poised to continue to implement measures locally and regionally, in order to meet the challenges which action on climate change demands, in line with the paris agreement.   imo has adopted its own initial imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships, which  envisages a reduction of co2 emissions per unit of transport work, the so-called carbon intensity, as an average across international shipping, of at least 40% by 2030  - and, at the same time, pursuing efforts towards a 70% reduction by 2050, compared to 2008. it also envisages a reduction of total annual ghg emissions of at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008, aiming to phase them out as soon as possible. the role of mtccs is specifically captured in the imo initial strategy. ""if international shipping is to achieve at least 50% reduction by 2050, what this really means is an average 85% emissions reduction per ship,"" said edmund hughes, head, air pollution and energy efficiency, imo. ""the mtccs are looking into technical and operational measures for energy efficiency - and this is why the mtccs are so important; and we commend them.""about the gmn projectthe gmn project is funded by the european union and implemented by the international maritime organization (imo).   the project was born out of a concept to develop a global network of maritime technology cooperation centres to accelerate capacity building and technology transfer in the maritime field. this idea was mooted in september 2015 during the inaugural future-ready shipping conference, a joint imo-singapore international conference on maritime technology transfer and capacity building. four years on, and thanks to a €10 million funding contribution from the european union , the gmn project has come into fruition and five mtccs have been established and have, to date, involved more than 2,210 participants in more than 50 maritime energy efficiency workshops, as well as delivering on pilot projects. they are:  mtcc africa; mtcc asia; mtcc caribbean; mtcc latin america; and mtcc pacific. ec funding for the project has now been confirmed until september 2020. gmn website:  http://gmn.imo.org/mtccs:mtcc-africa, hosted by jomo kenyatta university of agriculture and technology, mombasa, kenyamtcc-asia, hosted by shanghai maritime university, chinamtcc-caribbean, hosted by university of trinidad and tobago, trinidad and tobagomtcc-latin america, hosted by international maritime university of panama, panamamtcc-pacific, hosted by the pacific community (spc)

                                    imo's maritime safety committee (msc), which met at the organization's london headquarters for its 94th session, from 17 to 21 november 2014, approved draft solas amendments to make mandatory the international code of safety for ships using gases or other low- flashpoint fuels (igf code); adopted other solas amendments; continued its work on its action plan on passenger ship safety; and approved and adopted a number of items put forward by the sub-committees. 
the msc also adopted the polar code and related amendments to the international convention for the safety of life at sea (solas) to make it mandatory (see briefing 38/2014).  

solas amendments to make igf code mandatory approved
the msc approved, in principle, the draft international code of safety for ships using gases or other low-flashpoint fuels (igf code), and also approved proposed amendments to make the code mandatory under solas, with a view to adopting both the igf code and solas amendments at the next session, msc 95, scheduled to meet in june 2015. 

associated draft amendments to the 1978 and 1988 protocols were also approved.  

the igf code will provide mandatory provisions for the arrangement, installation, control and monitoring of machinery, equipment and systems using low-flashpoint fuels, focusing initially on liquefied natural gas (lng),  to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and the environment, having regard to the nature of the fuels involved.

the code addresses all areas that need special consideration for the usage of low-flashpoint fuels, based on a goal-based approach, with goals and functional requirements specified for each section forming the basis for the design, construction and operation of ships using this type of fuel. 

adoption of solas amendments 
the msc adopted the following amendments, with an expected entry into force date of 1 july 2016:

•	amendments to solas chapter vi to require mandatory verification of the gross mass of containers, either by weighing the packed container; or weighing all packages and cargo items, using a certified method approved by the competent authority of the state in which packing of the container was completed; 

•	amendments to add a new solas regulation xi-1/7 on atmosphere testing instrument for enclosed spaces, to require ships to carry an appropriate portable atmosphere testing instrument or instruments, capable of measuring concentrations of oxygen, flammable gases or vapours, hydrogen sulphide and carbon monoxide, prior to entry into enclosed spaces. consequential amendments to the code for the construction and equipment of mobile offshore drilling units (1979, 1989 and 2009 modu codes) were also adopted. the msc also approved a related msc circular on early implementation of solas regulation xi-1/7 on atmosphere testing instrument for enclosed spaces; and

•	amendments to update the international code on the enhanced programme of inspections during surveys of bulk carriers and oil tankers (2011 esp code), including revisions to the minimum requirements for cargo tank testing at renewal survey and addition of a new paragraph on rescue and emergency response equipment in relation to breathing apparatus.   

e-navigation strategy approved
the msc approved the e-navigation strategy implementation plan (sip), which provides a framework and a road map of tasks that would need to be implemented or conducted in the future to give effect to five prioritized e navigation solutions:

•	improved, harmonized and user-friendly bridge design;
•	means for standardized and automated reporting;
•	improved reliability, resilience and integrity of bridge equipment and navigation information;
•	integration and presentation of available information in graphical displays received via communication equipment; and
•	improved communication of vessel traffic services (vts) service portfolio (not limited to vts stations).

a number of tasks have been identified for development and completion during the period 2015 to 2019. the msc approved guidelines on harmonization of test beds reporting, aimed at harmonizing the way the results of testbeds are reported to the organization.

work on passenger ships safety continued
the msc continued its ongoing work related to passenger ship safety and updated its long-term action plan on passenger ship safety, following consideration of the outcome of the sub-committee on implementation of imo instruments (iii) on the casualty report on the costa concordia and other proposals received. the updated long-term action plan includes, among others, a new item on the possible extension, to existing passenger ships, of the solas requirement relating to computerized stability support for the master in case of flooding and a new item on watertight doors maintenance. 

cyber security matters considered 
the committee considered a proposal to develop voluntary guidelines on cyber security practices to protect and enhance the resiliency of cyber systems supporting the operations of ports, vessels, marine facilities and other elements of the maritime transportation system and agreed to coordinate its future work on this matter with the facilitation committee. 

the msc also agreed that cyber security was an important and timely issue, but that the organization should not take unilateral action on this matter without consultation with other united nations bodies and relevant international organizations such as the international telecommunication union (itu). member states and observer organizations were invited to consider the issue and submit proposals to the next session of the committee.

                                    the international maritime organization (imo) will sponsor a number of women from developing countries to follow a new maritime leadership programme, as part of the organization's ongoing work to support gender diversity in the maritime sector.the initiative was announced during the first maritime sheeo conference, which brought together maritime experts in a virtual space on 23 november, to debate the theme ""diversity and sustainability: the business case"". maritime sheeo works towards creating the next generation of female maritime leaders.speaking at the opening session, imo secretary-general kitack lim emphasized the importance of female representation and diversity in the maritime sector and beyond. ""empowering women fuels thriving economies across the world, spurs growth and development, and benefits everyone working in the global maritime community and beyond,"" he said.the conference comes at a time when the impact of the gender equality gap is undeniable. research shows the covid-19 pandemic is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities and threatening to halt or reverse the gains of decades of collective effort – with data revealing that the pandemic will push 47 million more women and girls below the poverty line. we are also witnessing increased reports on violence against women throughout the world due to the lockdowns, and women losing their livelihoods faster, because they are more exposed to hard-hit economic sectors. turning this around is a priority for the united nations (un) and for imo, as part of the un family.the maritime sheeo leadership accelerator programme aims to equip women with the leadership skills and confidence to take a seat at the shipping decision-making table.helen buni, representing imo's women in maritime programme, said imo sponsorship would enable the selected women from government administrations to benefit from the leadership scheme, which will include training, mentoring and networking opportunities. this is in line with imo's goal to help the maritime sector to move forward and to promote women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life. this scheme will complement access to high-level technical training courses, under which imo sponsors female participants each year. the women in maritime programme aims to help member states achieve the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs), particularly goal 5: ""achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls"".the leadership programme is expected to be fully launched by international women's day (iwd), 8 march 2021. the 2021 iwd theme ""women in leadership: achieving an equal future in a covid-19 world"" celebrates the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the covid-19 pandemic.referring to the challenges of the covid-19 pandemic, several speakers spoke about the essential contribution made by women on the frontline of the pandemic and also disproportionate burdens. there was a clear need to address these issues in the maritime sector during the post-covid recovery.""we must use this opportunity to rebuild from this crisis inclusively, equitably and sustainably, and put women's leadership and contributions at the heart of resilience and recovery,"" said imo secretary-general lim. ""people are at the heart of this industry, at every level. we must ensure we manage the sector in such a way that we utilize all talent across the gender divide.""dr. cleopatra doumbia-henry, president of the world maritime university (wmu) and ms. elda belja, lecturer and admissions officer of the imo international maritime law institute (imli), highlighted the importance of education and training to promote equality and empower women. educational opportunities are important in order  to ensure the full and effective participation of women and equal opportunities at all levels of decision-making. imli reserves 50% of its places on its masters level courses for women, while more than 1,000 females have graduated from wmu.other speakers at the conference covered a range of topics relevant to the maritime sector, including stereotypes surrounding careers roles, impacts of covid-19 on women's participation, new technologies and digitalization, business models post covid-19, stakeholders' collaborations, young maritime professionals' contributions, and leadership of women from around the world. the event, attended by 1,500 participants from 70 countries, was organized by maritime sheeo, an entity that works to promote gender diversity in the maritime industry. women in maritime - imo's gender programmesince imo's gender programme was initiated in 1988, imo has supported gender equality and the empowerment of women through different initiatives such as, gender specific fellowships; by facilitating access to high-level technical training for women in the maritime sector in developing countries; by creating the environment in which women are identified and selected for career development opportunities in maritime administrations, ports and maritime training institutes; and by facilitating the establishment of professional women in maritime associations, particularly in developing countries. under the slogan: ""training-visibility-recognition"", imo has taken a strategic approach towards enhancing the contribution of women as key maritime stakeholders. raising awareness is crucial and examples include the turning the tide film and the social media wall and women in maritime photo bank, #maritimewomenphotoshare. imo has invited women of the maritime sector to share photos of themselves at work, using the hashtag #maritimewomenphotoshare with the aim of showing a diverse representation of maritime roles, so that young women can be inspired when deciding to embark on a maritime career. building beyond world maritime day 2019in 2019 ""empowering women in the maritime community"" was selected as the world maritime theme, providing an opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of gender equality, and to highlight the important contribution of women all over the world to the maritime sector.also in 2019, the imo assembly adopted a resolution urging further firm action in coming years to advance gender equality throughout the maritime sector and reach a barrier-free environment.further informationfor further information, please see: https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/technicalcooperation/pages/womeninmaritime.aspx",2021-04-16

                                amendments to marpol annex v on prevention of pollution by garbage from ships entered into force on 1 march 2018.
                                    requirements for ships to collect data on their fuel oil consumption entered into force on 1 march. other important amendments to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships (marpol) have also entered into force, covering the classification of garbage, including the addition of a new category of “e-waste”, and amendments to the international oil pollution prevention certificate.ship fuel oil consumption data reporting requirements the ship fuel oil consumption data reporting requirements are the latest mandatory requirements aimed at enhancing the energy efficiency of international shipping.  the data collection will begin on 1 january 2019 with data reported at the end of each calendar year to the international maritime organization (imo), the united nations agency with responsibility for regulating the safety, security and efficiency of shipping and preventing marine and atmospheric pollution from ships. the data collection system is intended to equip imo with concrete data on fuel oil consumption, which should assist member states in making decisions about any further measures needed to enhance energy efficiency and address greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping.the mandatory requirements were adopted by imo’s marine environment protection committee (mepc) in 2016, through  amendments to chapter 4 of annex vi of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships (marpol). under the new regulation 22a on collection and reporting of ship fuel oil consumption data, ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above are required to collect consumption data for each type of fuel oil they use, as well as other, additional, specified data including proxies for transport work.  these ships account for approximately 85% of co2 emissions from international shipping.the aggregated data will be reported to the flag state after the end of each calendar year and the flag state, having determined that the data has been reported in accordance with the requirements, will issue a statement of compliance to the ship.  flag states will be required to subsequently transfer this data to an imo ship fuel oil consumption database.  imo will be required to produce an annual report to the mepc, summarizing the data collected. in addition, on or before 31 december 2018, in the case of a ship of 5,000 gross tonnage and above, the mandatory ship energy efficiency management plan (seemp) shall include a description of the methodology that will be used to collect the data and the processes that will be used to report the data to the ship's flag state. the new mandatory data collection system is intended to be the first in a three-step approach in which analysis of the data collected will provide the basis for an objective, transparent and inclusive policy debate in the mepc, under a roadmap (through to 2023) for developing a “comprehensive imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships”. the roadmap was agreed in 2016. the next stage in the process will see an initial ghg strategy expected to be adopted by the mepc at its 72nd session (9-13 april 2018). the mepc session will be preceded by the third session of the intersessional working group on reduction imo of ghg emissions from ships (3-6 april). the initial strategy is expected to include, inter alia, a list of candidate short-, mid-, and long-term further measures, with possible timelines, to be revised as appropriate as additional information becomes available. the data collected under the mandatory reporting system will help inform the mepc when it comes to adopting a revised strategy in 2023. in 2011, imo became the first international body to adopt mandatory energy-efficiency measures for an entire industry sector with a suite of technical and operational requirements for new and existing vessels that entered into force in 2013. by 2025 new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built in 2014.garbage requirements under marpol annex v amendments to marpol annex v on prevention of pollution by garbage from ships also enter into force on 1 march 2018. they relate to cargo residues of products which are hazardous to the marine environment (hme) and form of garbage record book. in particular, amendments to regulation 4 and 6 of annex v require the shipper to declare whether or not they are classed as harmful to the marine environment. a new appendix provides criteria for the classification of solid bulk cargoes. the form of garbage record book is updated. the record of garbage discharges is divided into part i for the use of all ships and part ii, required for ships that carry solid bulk cargoes.a new category of garbage “e-waste” is included. e-waste is defined in the 2017 guidelines for implementation of marpol annex v as electrical and electronic equipment used for the normal operation of the ship or in the accommodation spaces, including all components, subassemblies and consumables, which are part of the equipment at the time of discarding, with the presence of material potentially hazardous to human health and/or the environment.amendments to international oil pollution prevention certificate amendments to update form b of the supplement to the international oil pollution prevention certificate, in relation to segregated ballast tanks, also enter into force on 1 march 2018.",2021-04-16

                                <U+200B>the 30th assembly of imo is meeting in london at imo headquarters from 27 november to 6 december 2017.
                                    assembly, 30th session, 27 november to 6 december 2017: climate change, digital disruption and sustainable development among key areas as imo moves into new era.the secretary-general of the international maritime organization (imo), mr. kitack lim, has urged member states to seize the opportunity to set bold and ambitious goals, when they adopt an initial strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping in 2018. speaking (full speech here) at the opening of the organization’s 30th assembly session, secretary-general lim told delegates the whole world would be watching imo in 2018, looking for something of real substance. “next year really will be a time when the world will expect imo member states to deliver a clear vision as the first stage of the approved roadmap. i urge you, be bold; set ambitious goals that really will make a difference. you have a real opportunity here to do something of lasting significance. make the most of it,” he told the packed plenary hall at imo headquarters in london. imo’s marine environment protection committee (mepc) is set to adopt an initial ghg strategy in april 2018.more than 1,500 delegates from imo member states, international governmental and non-governmental organizations have registered to attend the 30th session of the imo assembly meets from 27 november to 6 december.  mr. lim outlined the key elements of the new “strategic plan for the organization” for 2018 to 2023, which is expected to be adopted by the assembly.“the seven strategic directions point us now towards more effective rule-making and implementation processes by integrating new and advancing technology to respond to our challenges, among others, to increase ship safety, including addressing new emerging technologies such as autonomous vessels, our contribution to combat climate change, engagement in ocean governance, mitigation of cyber-crimes, and facilitation of international trade, whilst continuing to take due consideration on the human element factor,” mr. lim said.he highlighted his ambition to transform imo into a “knowledge based organization”, with appropriate analysis to support and improve the already effective rule making process and enhance implementation.the rapidly increasing pace of change in every sphere raised a fundamental issue, since technology will move far quicker than the regulatory process, he said.  “digital disruption will arrive in the shipping world very soon; and, when it does, imo must be ready,” mr. lim said. “for me, this means the regulatory framework for shipping must be based firmly around goals and functions rather than prescriptive solutions. this is the only way to ensure that measures adopted by imo are not rendered obsolete by the time-lag between adoption and entry-into-force. i know we have already made good steps in that direction but we must go further and faster in the coming years.”the organization as a whole needed to become more effective, more nimble and more adaptive, mr. lim said, drawing attention to his determination to push forward a ""knowledge based organization"" concept, embracing data in the secretariat’s work and in the decision-making processes. “we are in the era of digitalization and at the united nations level we are already looking at frontier issues that include emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and the benefits they could have in society as a whole, and to remain relevant,” mr. lim said.“for imo, we need to have more detailed and deeper analysis of statistics and data so that we can really understand underlying trends and causal factors behind shipping casualties; and we must make sure that additions and amendments to the regulatory framework are also based, wherever possible, on relevant statistics, studies and analysis. this would pave the way for better regulation, one that not only takes into account the work carried out to reduce administrative burdens, but to avoid disproportionate requirements, as well as addressing obsolete and unnecessary ones.”imo’s work to support the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the associated sustainable development goals was also stressed. “because most of the elements of the 2030 agenda will only be realized with a sustainable transport sector supporting world trade and facilitating the global economy, aspects of imo’s work can be linked to almost all of the individual sdgs,” mr. lim said.  mr. lim concluded by referring to the forthcoming anniversary in 2018, marking 70 years since the convention establishing imo was adopted in march 1948. “the theme we have selected for next year – “our heritage – better shipping for a better future” – looks both at the past and into the next 70 years that lie ahead. it provides an opportunity to reflect and showcase how imo has adapted over the years as a crucial player to the global supply chain,” he said. the rt hon mr. john hayes cbe mp, minister of state for transport legislation and maritime of the united kingdom government, also welcomed delegates to the assembly, as the representative of the host state.  the outgoing president of the assembly, mr. federico trillo-figueroa y martínez-conde, former ambassador of the kingdom of spain to the united kingdom and former permanent representative of spain to imo, and the incoming president, his excellency mr. rolando drago rodríguez, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and permanent representative of chile to imo, also addressed the assembly.election of officersthe assembly elected the following officers:  assembly presidenthis excellency mr. rolando drago rodríguez, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and permanent representative of chile to imo.vice-presidents1st vice-president: his excellency mr. euripides l. evriviades, high commissioner and permanent representative of cyprus to imo;

                                    the republic of korea and the international maritime organization (imo) have signed an agreement to establish a training programme to support developing states to reduce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions from shipping. this will facilitate the implementation of candidate measures to be adopted  by imo and the development of national action plans to reduce ghg emissions from the shipping and ports sectors.the sustainable maritime transport training programme (ghg-smart) will focus on least developed countries (ldcs) and small island developing states (sids). it will help them to develop their capacity to achieve the goals set out in the initial imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships. the imo strategy envisages reducing total annual ghg emissions from ships by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008, meaning a reduction in carbon intensity for individual ships and a move to new technologies and low/zero carbon fuels. a number of specific measures are under consideration to achieve the ambitious targets.the strategy recognizes that there are potential barriers to achieving the targets and highlights the need for supportive measures, including capacity building, technical cooperation, technology transfer and research and development (r&d), particularly in developing countries. the four-year ghg-smart programme will, therefore, support states (specifically, sids and ldcs) to address gaps in technologies and policies, by building knowledge and capacity in those countries to identify ways to effectively implement measures contained in the imo strategy. this would be complemented by support and training to develop and implement national action plans. it is widely recognized that national action plans may facilitate the implementation of imo-adopted measures in the national context and support the achievement of international commitments through national action.the agreement for the us$2.5 million training programme was signed (on 27 october) by imo secretary-general mr. kitack lim and the minister of oceans and fisheries of the republic of korea dr. seong-hyeok moon.thanking the government of the republic of korea for their generous funding for the programme, mr. lim said, ""if we are to achieve the goals in the initial imo strategy, then we must ensure that no country is left behind in the transition to carbon-neutral shipping. imo continues to lead the way with the portfolio of continuously expanding technical cooperation and capacity building projects. this training programme will greatly enhance the implementation of the initial imo ghg strategy, especially when it comes to building knowledge and capacity  in sids and ldcs.""dr. moon said, ""the republic of korea is fully supportive of the initial imo strategy on reduction of ghg emissions from ships and the emphasis on its ""voyage together"" approach. the government of the republic of korea hopes that this ghg smart training programme will be the beginning of a concerted effort to assist the sids and ldcs with the implementation of the imo strategy.""ghg-smart training and capacity buildingtraining packages will be developed to cover a range of activities, including analysis and review of current policies, update on imo regulations, how to develop national action plans, training of trainers to implement specific measures such as data collection, sharing of information and best practices. it is envisaged that participants will come from a range of different stakeholders, including policy makers, public authorities and industry (shipping, ports and ship building). the training will also facilitate transfer and uptake of energy efficient technologies, filling gaps in technology and policies between developed countries and the ldcs and sids. link with other imo-executed ghg emission reduction projects the programme will be strategically linked to the ongoing and proposed major projects implemented by imo to achieve ghg emissions reduction. these include the global mttc network (gmn) project, funded by the european union, which unites maritime technologies cooperation centres (mtccs) in targeted regions into a global network; and the greenvoyage2050 project , a partnership project between the government of norway and imo, which is working with 12 pilot countries in different regions to meet climate change and energy efficiency goals related to international shipping. there will also be cooperation with the world maritime university (wmu) for technical input, and imo's integrated technical cooperation programme (itcp).funding  this four-year programme will be funded through an allocation of us$2.5 million under the existing memorandum of understanding (mou) between imo and the republic of korea on the republic of korea's contribution to the delivering strategy and reform – voyage together trust fund (dsr-vt tf). further informationfor further information, please see https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/partnershipsprojects/pages/default.aspx",2021-04-16

                                    onboard the ocean diamond expedition ship, eco-tourists gaze at the breath-taking beauty of the antarctic landscape. this is the chance to encounter some unique wildlife, and marvel at the sheer majesty of the glaciers and the icebergs. for them, it is the trip of a lifetime. to make the new film about the polar code, an imo team visited the ocean diamond en voyage in the antarctic, to find out at first-hand what the code means for ships like this. as ocean diamond’s captain oleg klaptenko confirmed, operating in polar waters is the ultimate test of his ship, and his skills as a professional seafarer.“there are several sources of danger. low temperature, bad visibility, very long polar night and polar day. remoteness from our home and from human facility that can help you. it is also lack of good, accurate and complete hydrographic service,” says captain klaptenko.  with more and more ships navigating in polar waters, the international maritime organization (imo) - the united nations agency with responsibility for regulating the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of pollution from ships - has addressed international concern about the protection of the polar environment and the safety of seafarers and passengers. it has introduced new regulations that all ships operating in these harsh and challenging waters must comply with. the polar code entered into force on 1 january 2017. it sets out mandatory standards that cover the full range of design, construction, equipment, operational, training and environmental protection matters for ships making polar voyages.   these rules go above and beyond existing imo requirements such as those governing prevention of pollution from ships (marpol) and safety of life at sea (solas). all the extensive safety and environmental regulations included in these and other imo conventions still apply to shipping in polar waters. the polar code has two main sections. one deals with the safety of the ship and personnel, the other with protecting the environment. ships are already subject to strict environmental regulations under the marpol convention, but the polar code adds another level. discharging oil or oily mixtures into the sea, for example, is strictly prohibited under the polar code, and all oil tankers must have double hull and double bottom construction to prevent oil spills in case of an accident.imo’s new film shows some of the equipment specific to polar operations carried aboard ocean diamond - the ice picks needed to hack off any ice build-up on deck and the thermal suits for crew and passengers to be used in case of emergency, for example; and the system incorporated into the large windows on the bridge to pour hot water down the outside to melt the ice, as well as a heated panel to ensure visibility remains perfect.operationally, voyage planning is crucial, as is receiving accurate and up-to-date information about the state of the ice and the weather. and there are means of communication that can be used where satellite coverage is poor.     in the galley, where a dedicated team of chefs, cooks and helpers cater for more than 200 ravenous tourists and hungry crew every day, there are bins to collect food waste, paper and plastic waste which, aboard ocean diamond, is bagged up and taken ashore. the polar code has strict rules for dumping waste, and animal carcasses.for the crew, navigating in polar waters places special challenges. “due to the polar code, all crew members, as senior officers, as ratings, they have to pass special education, tests and certificates, they have to be certified for and get permission for sailing in polar waters,” says captain klaptenko, who has been sailing in polar waters for 25 years and recognizes the value of specialist training. more seafarers will need to get these skills, as shipping activity in polar regions is set to grow in volume and diversity over the coming years. receding sea ice is opening up these inhospitable regions to both commercial shipping and tourism. as the film stresses, the issue is not whether this activity is a good thing. the issue how it is managed so that we protect the environment and safeguard the lives of people who live and work in such a remote arena. and that is where imo’s polar code comes in. see how the polar code comes into play aboard the ocean diamond, in a new imo film, which is available now on imo’s youtube channel.",2021-04-16

                                    imo secretary-general kitack lim has spoken out against “no crew change” clauses in charterparties, pointing out that such clauses exacerbate the dire situation of stranded seafarers and undermine the efforts undertaken to resolve the ongoing crew change crisis. so-called “no crew change” clauses, which are demanded by certain charterers, state that no crew changes can occur whilst the charterer’s cargo is onboard – hence not allowing the ship to deviate to ports where crew changes could take place. imo’s seafarer crisis action team (scat) has been made aware of this worrying development in recent weeks. in a strong statement (issued via circular letter on 18 december), supported by the international labour organization (ilo), mr lim called upon all charterers to refrain from requesting to include “no crew change” clauses in charterparties, and further called upon shipowners and operators to reject them if they are demanded.  “such clauses exacerbate the mental and physical fatigue among exhausted seafarers, undermine compliance with the provisions of the maritime labour convention, 2006, as amended (mlc, 2006) and further threaten the safety of navigation”, mr lim said. he added that alternative contractual clauses that do allow for crew changes during the pandemic are available and should be utilized.  “resolving the crew change crisis requires the best efforts of all stakeholders.  the elimination of the use of “no crew change” clauses is just one of those efforts”, the secretary-general said, reaffirming the commitment of the organisation to assist all member states, the industry and seafarers in this regard. international organizations  made statements at the latest meeting of imo’s legal committee, leg 107, to condemn the use of “no crew change” clauses in charterparties. the committee invited submissions on the matter to its 108th session, scheduled to take place in july 2021.  as the crew change crisis now enters its tenth month, hundreds of thousands of seafarers remain onboard ships well beyond the expiration of their seafarer employment agreements, some not being paid and all unable to be repatriated. a similar number remain unable to join ships, and as a result find themselves unable to begin their contracts and earn a living.  “the situation continues to constitute a humanitarian crisis that threatens not only seafarers’ health and wellbeing but also the safety of navigation and the uninterrupted flow of the global supply chain”, mr lim insisted, adding: “policies or practices that prevent or inhibit safe, regular crew changes should be revised or eliminated.” as of 18 december, 46 imo member states and one associate member* have designated seafarers as key workers. this is essential to exempt these professionals from specific covid-related travel restrictions, allowing them to travel between their country of residence and ships, and to be repatriated at the end of their contracts. there have also been some encouraging signs of progress in the application of the industry-developed framework of protocols for ensuring safe crew changes and travel during the pandemic, which were endorsed by the maritime safety committee and circulated as msc.1/circ.1636.the plight of stranded seafarers is highlighted in an imo video featuring seafarers who describe the challenges they have faced due to the pandemic, and the impacts of the ongoing crew change crisis on their physical and mental health. *member states: azerbaijan, bahamas, bangladesh, barbados, belgium, brazil, canada, chile, cyprus, denmark, dominica, france, gabon, georgia, germany, ghana, greece,  indonesia, iran (islamic republic of), jamaica, japan, kenya, kiribati, liberia, marshall islands, moldova, montenegro, myanmar, netherlands, new zealand, nigeria, norway, panama, philippines, republic of korea, romania, saudi arabia, singapore, south africa, spain, sweden, thailand, united arab emirates, united kingdom, united states, yemen.   associate member: hong kong (china)",2021-04-16
