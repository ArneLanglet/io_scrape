New UN resolution reinforces link between human rights and the environment","https://undocs.org/pdf?symbol=en/A/HRC/46/L.6/REV.1, https://www.cbd.int/conferences/post2020, https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/one-health, https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/home.aspx, https://twitter.com/cronugva/status/1369235006888030211?s=21, https://www.un.org/en/content/action-for-human-rights/index.shtml#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20seven%20thematic%20areas,robust%20civic%20space%20for%20everybody%3B, https://www.ohchr.org/, https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html, https://www.unep.org/environmentassembly/unea5, https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/35407/KMBio.pdf, https://twitter.com/cronugva/status/1369235006888030211?s=21, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ze7JuKveUI, https://undocs.org/A/RES/64/292","in late march, the united nations human rights council adopted a resolution that calls for a human-rights-based approach to conserving and restoring natural spaces. we speak with the acting director of the united nations environment programme’s (unep’s) law division, arnold kreilhuber, to find out how the resolution will help safeguard the environment and contribute to sustainable development. 
united nations environment programme (unep): the human rights council adopted its first resolution on human rights and the environment in 2011. what has changed since then and how is this resolution different?
arnold kreilhuber (ak): since 2011 we have seen important developments regarding the undeniable link between human rights and the environment, which are reflected in this resolution (46/l.6.rev1). 
first, the human rights obligations on states relating to the environment have become clearer and more accepted.  more than 155 states have now recognized some form of a right to a healthy environment in international agreements or their national constitutions, legislation, or policies. 
second, the resolution notes and advances the need for a human-rights-based approach in the context of conserving, restoring and sustainably using biodiversity, particularly in the context of the ongoing post-2020 biodiversity framework negotiations and the one health initiative. third, all the resolutions adopted by the human rights council on human rights and the environment over the last decade have, step-by-step, paved the way for the possible global recognition of the right to a healthy environment. the last decade of action on this topic resulted in a statement by states in which they commit to proceeding with negotiations towards adopting a resolution proclaiming the right by the un.
unep: how will the resolution affect the work of unep and how could it contribute to the achievement of global environmental and human rights goals?
ak: the resolution is a strong vote of confidence in unep’s work on environmental rights.  it welcomes unep’s work, particularly in the implementation of the un secretary general’s call to action for human rights. it will help advance our ongoing partnership on environmental rights with the office of the high commissioner for human rights (ohchr), the un development programme (undp) and other key partners.
the resolution explicitly recalls the fifth session of the united nations environment assembly in february 2021, where member states endorsed unep’s medium-term strategy.  this is an important acknowledgement of unep’s commitment to work on advancing human rights obligations related to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. 
unep: the resolution calls on states to take a rights-based approach to biodiversity-related matters.  what does this mean in a practical sense?
ak: this is a very important and timely call as the world is preparing to adopt a new global biodiversity framework in 2021. the integration of environmental and human rights would be key to ensuring a healthy, biologically diverse and sustainable planet for present and future generations and in supporting the achievement of the sustainable development goals (sdgs).
to assist states and other stakeholders in taking a rights-based approach, unep and ohchr published key messages on biodiversity and human rights. the messages set out ways of incorporating a rights-based approach to biodiversity-related matters, which include practices related to participation in land and resource governance, accountability, cooperation at all levels, education, and the protection of indigenous peoples and environmental human rights defenders engaged in biodiversity-related protection activities.







more than 155 states have now recognized some form of a right to a healthy environment.




arnold kreilhuber, unep







unep: states also signed a joint statement, expressing their intent to proceed with discussions for a resolution on the right to a healthy environment. what is the significance of this statement and what issues will be discussed? 
ak: this is a remarkable outcome. the joint statement, signed by 69 states, represents an unprecedented level of support for the global recognition of the right to a healthy environment and a commitment to proceed with the process of formalising this recognition. a number of states in the past have expressed their support for the global recognition of the right but an explicit, strong intent signed by 69 states has never before been accomplished.
such a statement helps to accelerate the momentum built around the recognition of the right to a healthy environment. this has the support of the un secretary-general, heads of un agencies, including the executive director of unep, 15 un entities as well as over 1,100 civil society and indigenous organizations who signed a pledge calling for the recognition of that right. 
the next steps will depend on states as it will be an inter-governmental negotiation with the participation of other stakeholders. we expect that states will discuss procedural aspects of the resolution and substantive aspects of the right, including the scope and content of the resolution. unep is fully committed to supporting states in achieving this goal.
unep: what are the benefits of the global recognition?
ak: unep sees several benefits of the recognition of the right to a healthy environment. among others, unep expects that the global recognition of the right to a healthy environment will serve as a catalyst in addressing a triple planetary crisis: climate change, loss of biodiversity and pollution.
evidence shows that the recognition of the right to a healthy environment has contributed to stronger environmental laws and policies, improved implementation and enforcement of those laws and policies, increased levels of public participation in environmental decision-making and has enhanced access to information and access to justice. in short, it has contributed to improved environmental outcomes. 
the recognition of the right to a healthy environment at the global level will support efforts to address environmental crises in a more coordinated, effective and non-discriminatory manner, help achieve the sdgs, provide stronger protection of rights and of the people defending the environment, and help create a world where people can live in harmony with nature.
unep: do un resolutions make a difference? is there any evidence of that from the past?
ak: studies show that un resolutions have made a difference.  an example can be drawn from the process of the formal recognition of the right to water and sanitation as an independent human right by the un general assembly resolution (64/292) in july 2010.  the recognition spurred the inclusion of the right to water and sanitation in national constitutions, laws and policies and resulted in positive effects on global water governance and outcomes.  since the adoption of the resolution, countless people have gained access to safe drinking water and sanitation, creating a transformative change in their lives. we expect the un resolution on the right to a healthy environment would have an important and positive impact on the lives of people on the ground.

these are three of a growing number of companies that are bucking an environmentally destructive trend towards fast fashion.
the textile industry, say observers, has long been primed for a circular makeover.
amid rapacious demand for cheap, on-trend clothing, it has become a major driver of climate change: some sources say that the textile sector accounts for about 8 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. producing one kilogram of textiles also uses over half a kilogram of chemicals, and consumes huge quantities of fresh water.

the future is circular: what biodiversity really means












press release


green pandemic recovery essential to close climate action gap – un report












 “the fashion industry has long been criticized for the impact it has on the environment,” said elisa tonda, head of consumption and production unit at the united nations environment programme (unep). “much of that criticism is justified. but at the same time, there is a lot of innovation happening right now that bodes well for the future.”
tonda made the comments ahead of the united nations environment assembly (unea), where some discussions focused on what’s known as the circular economy, that prizes reusing things – from beverage bottles to camisoles – instead of throwing them away.
unea will also see the launch of a global alliance on circular economy and resource efficiency, established by unep, the european commission and the united nations industrial development organization (unido). the alliance builds on existing regional initiatives (such as the african circular economy alliance) to speed up transition to a global circular economy through more efficient, equitable use of resources. it also promotes sustainable consumption, production and industrialization.
a good time for change




the economic recovery from covid-19 offers a rare opportunity to dramatically shift the trajectory of many industries, including textiles.
“tying financial stimulus packages to actions that align with the sustainable development goals and the paris agreement will lock in long-term resource efficiency and decouple economic growth from environmental degradation,” said archana datta, a project coordinator for india, at the switch-asia initiative, which promotes sustainable production and consumption.
circularity and sustainability also make economic sense for businesses, data suggests. even before covid-19, just 60 per cent of garments were sold at full price, creating billions of dollars of lost revenues. smart product design has the potential to eliminate production waste and reduce pollution across the processing phase, helping businesses save money.
circularity would also be good for the climate. switching to more circular business models, including fashion rentals, re-commerce, repair and refurbishment, could help the industry cut around 143 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030.
a green recovery




a unep study recently found that in order to make the fashion industry more sustainable, there needs to be stronger “governance” of the sector, more financing for planet-friendly innovations and a concerted effort to change the consumption habits of consumers.
several promising initiatives are already helping with the latter. through a smartphone app, ireland-based nuw allows users to swap rarely worn clothes instead of tossing them away. in the philippines, apparel company phinix collects waste textiles and transforms them into footwear and bags. their products have just 10 per cent of the carbon footprint of regular apparel. finally, by upcycling and avoiding plastic packaging, among other things, brazil fashion house refazenda has eliminated its solid waste.
unep is creating a roadmap to help other textile companies follow the lead of those businesses. set to be released in june 2021, it will showcase concrete actions that textile companies can adopt to green their business. 
 
the united nations environment assembly (unea) is the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment. it brings together representatives of the 193 member states of the un, businesses, civil society leaders and other stakeholders to agree on policies that will tackle climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.
the fifth session of unea (unea-5) will be held online on 22-23 february 2021, followed by an in-person meeting in nairobi in february 2022. the theme is “strengthening actions for nature to achieve the sustainable development goals”, emphasizing the central role nature plays in achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030. it also underlines how a low-carbon recovery from the covid-19 pandemic can accelerate sustainable development.

Yes, climate change is driving wildfires","https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/wildfire-smoke-crosses-us-on-jet-stream, https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/, https://www.ipcc.ch/","as wildfires sweep across the western united states, taking lives, destroying homes and blanketing the country in smoke, niklas hagelberg has a sobering message: this could be america’s new normal.
the climate change expert with the united nations environment programme (unep) says a fast-warming planet will likely lead to more record-breaking blazes, like those that have ravaged the states of california, oregon and washington in recent months.
we recently sat down with hagelberg to discuss the relationship between climate change and wildfires, and whether one-day infernos could make california unlivable.
unep: some people think climate change is a problem for future generations. but are we already seeing the early effects of it?
niklas hagelberg: yes. it’s here, right now. the planet is already 1.1°c warmer than it was in pre-industrial times and that is changing the world around us. i’ll give you a personal example. i’m 46 and when i was a teenager in southern finland, you could go rally driving on ice. now, you have to worry about walking on ice. you can ask pretty much anyone these days and i bet they’ll have a similar story to tell. our climate is changing into something we don’t recognize. and it doesn’t match the societies we have built.
unep: is climate change responsible for the blazes that have consumed parts of the western united states of america?
nh: forest fires are natural. but in recent years, we’ve seen a rise in the average temperature, which has led to an increase in evaporation. we’re also seeing extended droughts. the landscape is so dry from multiple years of gradual change, that suddenly there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of fires. in fact, one report from the university of california, berkley found the fire season in the western united states is now 75 days longer than it was in the 1970s.

unep: this year, 8,100 wildfires have erupted in california, killing 26 people and destroying 7,000-plus buildings. is this the new normal for the golden state?
nh: it could be. according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), climate change increases the likelihood of droughts, storms and other weather anomalies. those events that were once every 100 years are suddenly happening once every 10 years. based on the ipcc, we are moving towards an increasing frequency of fires, whether that’s forest fires or grassland fires – and many other dire consequences as well.
unep: could parts of california become unlivable in the not-too-distant future?
nh: i believe in human ingenuity. i’m sure we could come up with ways to survive. the question is more: isn’t it a beautiful world and isn’t california a beautiful place? i don’t want to lose that. we need to design a better future for ourselves and the planet – not just accept what’s coming and try to scrape by.
climate change is causing forest fires to become more frequent and more intense, says unep expert niklas hagelberg. photo by skeeze/pixabayunep: the 2020 fire season is among the worst on record in the united states. do you think it will finally prompt serious action on climate change?
nh: i think it will. i think we’ve now come to the stage where people know this is an emergency. once bad stuff starts hitting close to home, that’s when people react. it’s human nature. you don’t tend to stop smoking until you get bad news from your doctor.
unep: and this is bad news?
nh: this is bad news. this is bad for our health, for our wallet and for the fabric of society.
unep: the world is heading towards a global average temperature that’s 3°c to 4°c higher than  it was before the industrial revolution. for many people, that might not seem like a lot. what do you say to them?
nh: just think about your own body. when your temperature goes up from 36.7°c (98°f) to 37.7°c (100°f), you’ll probably consider taking the day off. if it goes 1.5°c above normal, you’re staying home for sure. if you add 3°c, people who are older and have preexisting conditions –  they may die. the tolerances are just as tight for the planet.

United in Science report: Climate change has not stopped for COVID19","https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/new-climate-predictions-assess-global-temperatures-coming-five-years, https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/","new york/geneva, 9 september 2020 - climate change has not stopped for covid19. greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and continue to increase. emissions are heading in the direction of pre-pandemic levels following a temporary decline caused by the lockdown and economic slowdown. the world is set to see its warmest five years on record – in a trend which is likely to continue - and is not on track to meet agreed targets to keep global temperature increase well below 2 °c or at 1.5 °c above pre-industrial levels.
this is according to a new multi-agency report from leading science organizations, united in science 2020. it highlights the increasing and irreversible impacts of climate change, which affects glaciers, oceans, nature, economies and human living conditions and is often felt through water-related hazards like drought or flooding. it also documents how covid-19 has impeded our ability to monitor these changes through the global observing system.
“this has been an unprecedented year for people and planet. the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted lives worldwide. at the same time, the heating of our planet and climate disruption has continued apace,” said un secretary-general antónio guterres in a foreword.
“never before has it been so clear that we need long-term, inclusive, clean transitions to tackle the climate crisis and achieve sustainable development. we must turn the recovery from the pandemic into a real opportunity to build a better future,” said mr guterres, who will present the report on 9 september. “we need science, solidarity and solutions.”
the united in science 2020 report, the second in a series, is coordinated by the world meteorological organization (wmo), with input from the global carbon project, the intergovernmental panel on climate change, the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco, the un environment programme and the uk met office. it presents the very latest scientific data and findings related to climate change to inform global policy and action.
“greenhouse gas concentrations - which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years - have continued to rise. meanwhile, large swathes of siberia have seen a prolonged and remarkable heatwave during the first half of 2020, which would have been very unlikely without anthropogenic climate change. and now 2016–2020 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record. this report shows that whilst many aspects of our lives have been disrupted in 2020, climate change has continued unabated,” said wmo secretary-general, professor petteri taalas.
key findings
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere (world meteorological organization)
atmospheric co2 concentrations showed no signs of peaking and have continued to increase to new records. benchmark stations in the wmo global atmosphere watch (gaw) network reported co2 concentrations above 410 parts per million (ppm) during the first half of 2020, with mauna loa (hawaii) and cape grim (tasmania) at 414.38 ppm and 410.04 ppm, respectively, in july 2020, up from 411.74 ppm and 407.83 ppm in july 2019.
reductions in emissions of co2 in 2020 will only slightly impact the rate of increase in the atmospheric concentrations, which are the result of past and current emissions, as well as the very long lifetime of co2.   sustained reductions in emissions to net zero are necessary to stabilize climate change.
global fossil co2emissions (global carbon project) 
co2 emissions in 2020 will fall by an estimated 4% to 7% in 2020 due to covid-19 confinement policies. the exact decline will depend on the continued trajectory of the pandemic and government responses to address it.
during peak lockdown in early april 2020, the daily global fossil co2 emissions dropped by an unprecedented 17% compared to 2019. even so, emissions were still equivalent to 2006 levels, highlighting both the steep growth over the past 15 years and the continued dependence on fossil sources for energy.
by early june 2020, global daily fossil co2 emissions had mostly returned to within 5% (1%–8% range) below 2019 levels, which reached a new record of 36.7 gigatonnes (gt) last year, 2% higher than at the start of climate change negotiations in 1990.
global methane emissions from human activities have continued to increase over the past decade. current emissions of both co2 and methane are not compatible with emissions pathways consistent with the targets of the paris agreement.
emissions gap (un environment programme) 
transformational action can no longer be postponed if the paris agreement targets are to be met.
the emissions gap report 2019 showed that the cuts in global emissions required per year from 2020 to 2030 are close to 3% for a 2 °c target and more than 7% per year on average for the 1.5 °c goal of the paris agreement.
the emissions gap in 2030 is estimated at 12-15 gigatonnes (gt) co2e to limit global warming to below 2 °c. for the 1.5 ° c goal, the gap is estimated at 29-32 gt co2e, roughly equivalent to the combined emissions of the six largest emitters.
it is still possible to bridge the emissions gap, but this will require urgent and concerted action by all countries and across all sectors. a substantial part of the short-term potential can be realized through scaling up existing, well-proven policies, for instance on renewables and energy efficiency, low carbon transportation means and a phase out of coal.
looking beyond the 2030 timeframe, new technological solutions and gradual change in consumption patterns are needed at all levels. both technically and economically feasible solutions already exist.
state of global climate (wmo and uk’s met office)
the average global temperature for 2016–2020 is expected to be the warmest on record, about 1.1 °c above 1850-1900, a reference period for temperature change since pre-industrial times and 0.24°c warmer than the global average temperature for 2011-2015.
in the five-year period 2020–2024, the chance of at least one year exceeding 1.5 °c above pre-industrial levels is 24%, with a very small chance (3%) of the five-year mean exceeding this level. it is likely (~70% chance) that one or more months during the next five years will be at least 1.5 °c warmer than pre-industrial levels.
in every year between 2016 and 2020, arctic sea ice extent has been below average. 2016–2019 recorded a greater glacier mass loss than all other past five-year periods since 1950. the rate of global mean sea-level rise increased between 2011–2015 and 2016–2020.
major impacts have been caused by extreme weather and climate events. a clear fingerprint of human-induced climate change has been identified on many of these extreme events.
the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (intergovernmental panel on climate change)
human-induced climate change is affecting life-sustaining systems, from the top of the mountains to the depths of the oceans, leading to accelerating sea-level rise, with cascading effects for ecosystems and human security.
this increasingly challenges adaptation and integrated risk management responses.
ice sheets and glaciers worldwide have lost mass. between 1979 and 2018, arctic sea-ice extent has decreased for all months of the year. increasing wildfire and abrupt permafrost thaw, as well as changes in arctic and mountain hydrology, have altered the frequency and intensity of ecosystem disturbances.
the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system. since 1993 the rate of ocean warming, and thus heat uptake has more than doubled. marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency and have become longer-lasting, more intense and more extensive, resulting in large-scale coral bleaching events. the ocean has absorbed between 20% to 30% of total anthropogenic co2 emissions since the 1980s causing further ocean acidification.
since about 1950 many marine species have undergone shifts in geographical range and seasonal activities in response to ocean warming, sea-ice change and oxygen loss.
global mean sea-level is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing rates of ice loss from the greenland and antarctic ice sheets, as well as continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. the rate of global mean sea-level rise for 2006–2015 of 3.6 ±0.5 mm/yr is unprecedented over the last century
climate and water resources (wmo)
climate change impacts are most felt through changing hydrological conditions including changes in snow and ice dynamics.
by 2050, the number of people at risk of floods will increase from its current level of 1.2 billion to 1.6 billion. in the early to mid-2010s, 1.9 billion people, or 27% of the global population, lived in potential severely water-scarce areas. in 2050, this number will increase to 2.7 to 3.2 billion people.
as of 2019, 12% of the world population drinks water from unimproved and unsafe sources. more than 30% of the world population, or 2.4 billion people, live without any form of sanitation.
climate change is projected to increase the number of water-stressed regions and exacerbate shortages in already water-stressed regions.
the cryosphere is an important source of freshwater in mountains and their downstream regions. there is high confidence that annual runoff from glaciers will reach peak globally at the latest by the end of the 21st century. after that, glacier runoff is projected to decline globally with implications for water storage.
it is estimated that central europe and caucasus have reached peak water now, and that the tibetan plateau region will reach peak water between 2030 and 2050. as runoff from snow cover, permafrost and glaciers in this region provides up to 45% of the total river flow, the flow decrease would affect water availability for 1.7 billion people.
earth system observations during covid-19 (intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco and wmo)
the covid-19 pandemic has produced significant impacts on the global observing systems, which in turn have affected the quality of forecasts and other weather, climate and ocean-related services.
the reduction of aircraft-based observations by an average of 75% to 80% in march and april degraded the forecast skills of weather models. since june, there has been only a slight recovery. observations at manually operated weather stations, especially in africa and south america, have also been badly disrupted.
for hydrological observations like river discharge, the situation is similar to that of atmospheric in situ measurements. automated systems continue to deliver data whereas gauging stations that depend on manual reading are affected.
in march 2020, nearly all oceanographic research vessels were recalled to home ports. commercial ships have been unable to contribute vital ocean and weather observations, and ocean buoys and other systems could not be maintained. four full-depth ocean surveys of variables such as carbon, temperature, salinity, and water alkalinity, completed only once per decade, have been cancelled. surface carbon measurements from ships, which tell us about the evolution of greenhouse gases, also effectively ceased.
the impacts on climate change monitoring are long-term. they are likely to prevent or restrict measurement campaigns for the mass balance of glaciers or the thickness of permafrost, usually conducted at the end of the thawing period. the overall disruption of observations will introduce gaps in the historical time series of essential climate variables needed to monitor climate variability and change and associated impacts.

Air pollution and climate change: two sides of the same coin","https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/taller-plants-warming-arctic-could-speed-climate-change, https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/, https://twitter.com/UNEnvironment, https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/index.shtml, https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/, https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/what-is-the-paris-agreement","erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, dust storms and meteorites smashing into the earth’s crust are natural phenomena that can cause climate change and air pollution: dinosaurs may have met their end after a giant meteorite kicked up so much dust that it blocked out the sun for decades, reducing photosynthesis and preventing the growth of plants.
adding to these potential threats, we have also been contributing to air pollution and global warming through our resource-intensive lifestyles. we’re producing and consuming more than ever before, and we’re generating more greenhouse gases as a result, as well as air pollutants in the form of chemicals and particulate matter, including “black carbon”. 
switching to renewable sources of energy is an important part of the solution to both climate change and air pollution. photo credit: hpgruesen/wikimedia commonsalthough they may seem to be two very different issues, climate change and air pollution are closely interlinked, so by reducing air pollution we also protect the climate. air pollutants include more than just greenhouse gases—principally carbon dioxide but also methane, nitrous oxide and others—but there’s a big overlap: the two often interact with each other. 
for instance, air pollution in the form of particulate matter from diesel engines is circulated around the globe, ending up in the most remote places, including the polar regions. when it lands on ice and snow it darkens them slightly, leading to less sunlight being reflected back into space, and contributing to global warming. the slightly warmer temperatures encourage plants in the sub-artic region to grow a tiny bit bigger, and as they grow through the snow they cast a shadow, which, when multiplied over millions of small plants, also has the effect of darkening the earth’s surface, leading to further warming.
the good news is that immediate changes to air pollution levels also have immediate effects. quick action on reducing highly potent, short-lived climate pollutants - methane, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and black carbon—can significantly decrease the chances of triggering dangerous climate tipping points, like the irreversible release of carbon dioxide and methane from thawing arctic permafrost.
in 2018 activists helped save the remaining part of hambach forest in northern germany in the face of plans to chop it down to expand a huge lignite mine. forests store carbon, promote biodiversity and cleanse the air. photo credit: creative commonsmeanwhile, we should continue cutting down on the release of long-lived greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. 
 “when addressing air pollution, we also address a critical and easy-to-implement solution to climate change. short-lived climate pollutants are negative in all senses, and we have proven technologies and policies to economically and immediately reduce air pollution,” says un environment climate change specialist niklas hagelberg.

a recent concern is trichlorofluoromethane, or cfc-11, which is to be phased out worldwide under the montreal protocol, the global agreement to protect the ozone layer. the industrial gas, used illegally, for example, in insulation material, also contributes to global warming. 
aerosols, the atmospheric pollutant with an effect on the climate 
the october 2018 report by the inter-governmental panel on climate change (ipcc) highlights the importance of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5°c below pre-industrial era levels. urgent action is need over the next 12 years if there is to be any chance of achieving this target.
aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin and can influence climate in several ways: “through both interactions that scatter and/or absorb radiation and through interactions with cloud microphysics and other cloud properties, or upon deposition on snow- or ice-covered surfaces thereby altering their albedo and contributing to climate feedback,” says the panel’s report.
it defines aerosols as “a suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size between a few nanometres and 10 µm that reside in the atmosphere for at least several hours.”
the report defines air pollution as “degradation of air quality with negative effects on human health or the natural or built environment due to the introduction, by natural processes or human activity, into the atmosphere of substances (gases, aerosols) which have a direct (primary pollutants) or indirect (secondary pollutants) harmful effect.”
air pollution is the theme for world environment day on 5 june 2019. the quality of the air we breathe depends on the lifestyle choices we make every day. learn more about how air pollution affects you, and what is being done to clean the air. what are you doing to reduce your emissions footprint and #beatairpollution?

One mangrove, a thousand hopes","","mangrove ecosystems support the planet and people in unique ways. many nigerians living near the river in cross river state know that. “mangroves provide the best firewood, as people who roast fish know,” says idem williamson, a villager living in esierebom community in cross river state. “but by cutting the wood, the mangroves disappeared. and without the mangroves, water floods our houses.”
the need to restore mangroves inspired williamson to get involved for a redd+ project that saw the whole community come together to plant more than 10,000 seedlings.
“the positive effect is that it controls the level of water coming in from the rivers and allows us to use the creeks for fishing. and we can pick the unwanted branches of the mangroves in specific areas for firewood.”
un-redd nigeria project iko esai staffpressure’s on for nigeria’s mangroves 
nigeria is said to have the largest mangrove ecosystem in africa, and some consider the cross river estuary mangrove to be one of the most important in the country. however, indigenous fishing communities on the coast harvest mangrove wood for household domestic use, in particular for cooking and smoking fish. this has put severe pressure on mangrove forests, leading to steady deforestation.
wood from mangrove forests is also used for housing material, scaffolding, fishing stakes and more. the increasing demand for mangrove wood and the steady encroachment and spread of the nypa palm, an invasive mangrove plant, has exposed the country’s mangrove forests to severe degradation.
restoration and replanting in cross river state
since 2010, the un-redd programme has provided valuable support for nigeria’s ambitious efforts at forest conservation, climate change mitigation and community development. cross river state, where more than 50 per cent of nigeria's tropical forests remain, is host to a community-based redd+ programme that promotes activities for poverty reduction, improvement of crop varieties and yields, gender empowerment, biodiversity, conversation and climate change mitigation. the programme has supported a total of 18 community projects with 540 households—or 2,000 people—participating.




“the goals of the community-based redd+ programme are to sustainably manage forests, encourage forest communities to move away from business as usual, and to improve the well-being of the people and the environment,” says moses ama, the national redd+ coordinator. “the only challenge is the slow pace of getting the funds and investments needed to deal with the poverty within forest communities.”
a partnership between the un-redd programme and the small grants program of the global environment fund has provided us$800,000 to different community initiatives in cross river state. villagers have been trained to improve cassava, afang and cocoyam farming, set up cassava processing mills and harvest non-timber forest products like bush mango to reduce forest loss through improved agricultural practices. over 15 different nurseries have been established and more than 10,000 seedlings raised and planted to regenerate degraded forests.
villagers have also been trained in protecting mangroves, as is the case in esierebom. “redd+ activities have been very successful in raising consciousness about the effects of mangrove loss,” says tony atah, the un- redd programme stakeholder engagement specialist in the area. “the esierebom community in cross river state has many households catching fish and using mangroves as their main source of energy. the fishermen were losing income because less mangroves means less fish. it was sad to see some people selling 6 kilos of mangrove wood for just 75 cents while doing significant damage to the ecosystem.”
tshirt expressing hope for mangrove projectthrough the un-redd programme, villagers like comfort akabum have learned to cut the invasive nypa palm and plant new mangrove seedlings. she is one of the villagers who works daily to cut the nypa and replant mangrove seedlings. “i make sure the mangrove grows well,” says akabum. “we have been replanting mangroves for the past five years and the volume of water flooding the river has diminished.”
as part of the community-based redd+ mangrove restoration project, the community has planted over 10,000 mangrove seedlings and developed a community mangrove management plan. “this allows the cutting of mangrove wood only in controlled areas, raising seedlings and replanting. mangroves are so important because the mangrove ecosystem absorbs more carbon than a tropical rainforest,” says atah.
“we hope that cross river state will become a model of excellence with its mangrove restoration and other community-based redd+ mangrove projects, and that it will be replicated elsewhere. currently, five other states are about to begin similar projects,” says moses ama, the national redd+ coordinator.

UNEP, IUCN to launch new €20m programme on ecosystem-based adaptation","https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/climate-change/what-we-do/climate-adaptation/ecosystem-based-adaptation/ecosystem-12, https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/en/, https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/, https://gca.org/global-commission-on-adaptation/adapt-our-world, https://gca.org/global-commission-on-adaptation/report, https://www.iucn.org/theme/ecosystem-management/our-work/ecosystem-based-approaches-climate-change-adaptation/friends-eba-feba, https://www.unenvironment.org/gan/, https://gca.org/global-commission-on-adaptation/report, https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/, https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/climate-change/what-we-do/climate-adaptation/ecosystem-based-adaptation/ecosystem-12, https://www.iucn.org/theme/ecosystem-management/our-work/ecosystem-based-approaches-climate-change-adaptation, https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/, https://tinyurl.com/tc4muuf","nairobi, 21 january 2020 - the un environment programme (unep) and the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) are jointly launching the global fund for ecosystem-based adaptation [2020-2024], which aims to provide targeted and rapid support mechanisms through seed capital for innovative approaches to ecosystem-based adaptation. at the recently concluded un climate change conference (cop 25) in madrid, the federal environment ministry of germany (bmu) announced that it would provide €20m for the new unep-iucn programme, officially titled “support for the implementation and upscaling of ecosystem-based adaptation.” 
ecosystem-based adaptation (eba) refers to the set of approaches that involve the management of ecosystems to reduce the vulnerability of human communities to climate change. the restoration of mangroves and coral reefs, for example, protects coastal areas from the impacts of rising sea levels, while planting and restoring vegetation on hillsides and mountains prevents erosion and landslides during extreme rainfall.
eba is a key pillar of the movement to promote ecosystem-based, or nature-based, measures for climate change adaptation, which have gained scientific and policy interest over the past few years due to their multiple benefits for people and the planet.
through its international climate initiative (iki), the bmu is now increasing its financial commitments for ecosystem-based adaptation by around €60 million, which includes the new unep-iucn programme.
germany’s federal environment minister svenja schulze commented: “nature often provides the best solutions for climate action and adaptation to climate change. in addition to climate action and nature conservation, such projects often bring social benefits as well: they help people in vulnerable developing countries in particular to adapt to climate change. people in these countries are often much more directly dependent on nature. this is equally true for agriculture and for coastal protection.""
the multi-year global eba fund, established by unep and iucn, will draw on and support the growing momentum behind nature-based solutions and eba, along with major movements such as the un decade on ecosystem restoration.
the fund will have a specific focus on working with local ngos and ingos with relevant eba experience and local presence, and with governments on specific gaps in technical knowledge and understanding.
“nature-based solutions are increasingly recognized as integral to global climate action,” said inger andersen, executive director of unep. “with this new programme, we are using the power of ecosystems to help societies adapt to climate change. ecosystem-based adaptation is now being undertaken by more and more governments and organizations all over the world.”

“this work demonstrates that it’s not only us that protects nature, but also nature that protects us,” she added. “we are grateful to the federal environment ministry of germany for its support of this important initiative.”
nature-based solutions, including ecosystem-based adaptation, were a central pillar of the un climate action summit in september 2019, with the global commission on adaptation (gca) launching its eight action tracks for adaptation, along with a landmark report that argued for the increase of nature-based and ecosystem-based measures for climate change adaptation. unep will be leading the action track for nature-based solutions, and the results of the global eba fund will contribute to addressing the barriers identified by the gca process.
“in 2009, iucn framed the concept of ecosystem-based adaptation, and since then has globally promoted its use to increase society’s resilience to climate change,” said dr. grethel aguilar, acting director general of iucn. “ecosystem services and biodiversity are our best allies against climate change, and if we all use them wisely, both the planet and humanity will thrive. the generous contribution of the german government will help us scale up actions that put nature at the centre of sustainable development.”
unep and iucn will be supporting target countries in implementing eba measures to meet their global plans and commitments. the measures funded by this programme will be supported by specific expertise- and capacity-building, while strengthening information, knowledge and political will for nature-based solutions to adaptation. to do so, iucn and unep will draw on their extensive existing networks, tools and expertise, including friends of ecosystem-based adaptation (feba), supported by iucn, and the global adaptation network, supported by unep.
the two organisations will serve as catalytic conveners by engaging key stakeholders to proactively scale up commitments through strategic partnerships, building on key high-level political processes.
the partnership between unep and iucn will leverage a long history of eba approaches and projects. together, iucn and unep have been involved in more than 80 eba-related projects since 2010.

a new assessment offers ten recommendations, and identifies one health as the optimal way to prevent and respond to future pandemics.
the rising trend in zoonotic diseases is driven by the degradation of our natural environment – through land degradation, wildlife exploitation, resource extraction, climate change, and other stresses.
nairobi, 6 july 2020 – as the covid-19 pandemic continues to take lives and disrupt economies across the world, a new report warns that further outbreaks will emerge unless governments take active measures to prevent other zoonotic diseases from crossing into the human population, and sets out ten recommendations to prevent future pandemics.
the report, preventing the next pandemic: zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission, is a joint effort by the united nations environment programme (unep) and the international livestock research institute (ilri).
it identifies seven trends driving the increasing emergence of zoonotic diseases, including increased demand for animal protein; a rise in intense and unsustainable farming; the increased use and exploitation of wildlife; and the climate crisis. the report finds that africa in particular, which has experienced and responded to a number of zoonotic epidemics including most recently, to ebola outbreaks, could be a source of important solutions to quell future outbreaks.
“the science is clear that if we keep exploiting wildlife and destroying our ecosystems, then we can expect to see a steady stream of these diseases jumping from animals to humans in the years ahead,” said unep executive director inger andersen. “pandemics are devastating to our lives and our economies, and as we have seen over the past months, it is the poorest and the most vulnerable who suffer the most. to prevent future outbreaks, we must become much more deliberate about protecting our natural environment.”

a “zoonotic disease” or “zoonosis” is a disease that has passed into the human population from an animal source. covid-19, which has already caused more than half a million deaths around the world, most likely originated in bats. but covid-19 is only the latest in a growing number of diseases – including ebola, mers, west nile fever and rift valley fever – whose spread from animal hosts into human populations has been intensified by anthropogenic pressures.
every year, some two million people, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, die from neglected zoonotic diseases. the same outbreaks can cause severe illness, deaths, and productivity losses among livestock populations in the developing world, a major problem that keeps hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers in severe poverty. in the last two decades alone, zoonotic diseases have caused economic losses of more than $100 billion, not including the cost of the covid-19 pandemic, which is expected to reach $9 trillion over the next few years.
african countries have an opportunity to lead pandemic prevention efforts 
zoonotic diseases are on the rise everywhere on the planet, and african countries – a number of which have successfully managed deadly zoonotic outbreaks – have the potential to leverage this experience to tackle future outbreaks through approaches that incorporate human, animal and environmental health. the continent is home to a large portion of the world’s remaining intact rainforests and other wild lands. africa is also home to the world’s fastest-growing human population, leading to an increase in encounters between livestock and wildlife and in turn, the risk of zoonotic diseases.
“the situation on the continent today is ripe for intensifying existing zoonotic diseases and facilitating the emergence and spread of new ones,” said ilri director general jimmy smith. “but with their experiences with ebola and other emerging diseases, african countries are demonstrating proactive ways to manage disease outbreaks. they are applying, for example, novel risk-based rather than rule-based approaches to disease control, which are best suited to resource-poor settings, and they are joining up human, animal and environment expertise in proactive one health initiatives.”
the report’s authors identify the one health approach -- which unites public health, veterinary and environmental expertise -- as the optimal method for preventing as well as responding to zoonotic disease outbreaks and pandemics.
10 recommendations
the report identifies ten practical steps that governments can take to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks:
investing in interdisciplinary approaches, including one health;
expanding scientific enquiry into zoonotic diseases;
improving cost-benefit analyses of interventions to include full-cost accounting of societal impacts of disease;
raising awareness of zoonotic diseases;
strengthening monitoring and regulation practices associated with zoonotic diseases, including food systems;
incentivizing sustainable land management practices and developing alternatives for food security and livelihoods that do not rely on the destruction of habitats and biodiversity;
improving biosecurity and control, identifying key drivers of emerging diseases in animal husbandry and encouraging proven management and zoonotic disease control measures;
supporting the sustainable management of landscapes and seascapes that enhance sustainable co-existence of agriculture and wildlife;
strengthening capacities among health stakeholders in all countries; and
operationalizing the one health approach in land-use and sustainable development planning, implementation and monitoring, among other fields.
the report launch comes on world zoonoses day, observed by research institutions and nongovernmental entities on 6 july, which commemorates the work of french biologist louis pasteur. on 6 july 1885, pasteur successfully administered the first vaccine against rabies, a zoonotic disease.

to mark world food day on 16 october, we take a closer look at sustainable agriculture – how it can help reduce our environmental footprint, improve our health and even create jobs.
what exactly is sustainable agriculture?
it is farming that meets the needs of existing and future generations, while also ensuring profitability, environmental health and social and economic equity. it favours techniques that emulate nature–to preserve soil fertility, prevent water pollution and protect biodiversity. it is also a way to support the achievement of global objectives, like the sustainable development goals and zero hunger.
does sustainable agriculture really make a difference to the environment?
yes. it uses up to 56 per cent less energy per unit of crops produced, creates 64 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions per hectare and supports greater levels of biodiversity than conventional farming.

it may be more costly because it is more labour-intensive. it is often certified in a way that requires it to be separated from conventional foods during processing and transport. the costs associated with marketing and distribution of relatively small volumes of product are often comparatively high. and, sometimes, the supply of certain sustainably produced foods is limited.
why are some foods so much more affordable–even when they require processing and packaging?
the heavy use of chemicals, medicines and genetic modification allows some foods to be produced cheaply and in reliably high volumes, so the retail price tag may be lower. but this is deceiving because it does not reflect the costs of environmental damage or the price of healthcare that is required to treat diet-related diseases. ultra-processed foods are often high in energy and low in nutrients and may contribute to the development of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some forms of cancer. this is particularly concerning amid the covid-19 pandemic; the disease is especially risky for those with pre-existing health problems.




 
consumers may not realize how their dietary choices affect the environment or even their own health. in the absence of either legal obligation or consumer demand, there is little incentive for producers to change their approach.






do we all have to be vegan?
no. but most of us should eat less animal protein. livestock production is a major cause of climate change and in most parts of the world, people already consume more animal-sourced food than is healthy. but even small dietary shifts can have a positive impact. the average person consumes 100 grams of meat daily.  reducing that by 10 grams could improve human health while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
is sustainable agriculture possible in developing countries?
yes. because sustainably produced food is typically more labour-intensive than conventionally made food, it has the potential to create 30 per cent more jobs. and because it can command higher prices, it can also generate more money for farmers.
is it possible to make sustainably produced food that is affordable for everyone?
yes. as demand for certain foods increases, the costs associated with production, processing, distribution and marketing will drop, which should make them less expensive for consumers.  policymakers can also play a role, facilitating market access and leveling the financial and regulatory playing field.

there is a lack of understanding of the way that agriculture, the environment and human health intersect. policymakers do not typically consider nature as a form of capital, so legislation is not designed to prevent pollution and other kinds of environmental degradation. and consumers may not realize how their dietary choices affect the environment or even their own health. in the absence of either legal obligations or consumer demand, there is little incentive for producers to change their approach.
what are some ways to consume food more sustainably?
diversify your diet and cook more meals at home. eat more plant-based foods; enjoy pulses, peas, beans and chickpeas as sources of protein. eat local, seasonal foods. purchase sustainably produced foods and learn more about farming practices and labeling. avoid excessive packaging, which is likely to end up as landfill. don’t waste food: eliminating food waste could reduce global carbon emissions by 8-10 per cent. cultivate your own garden, even if it is a small one in your kitchen. support organizations, policies and projects that promote sustainable food systems. and discuss the importance of healthy and sustainable foods with producers, vendors, policymakers, friends and family.
 
the united nations environment programme (unep) supports a transition toward global food systems that provide net-positive impacts on nutrition, the environment and farmer livelihoods. contributing to the one planet network sustainable food systems programme, unep has led the development of a guideline for collaborative policymaking and improved governance.
unep is also the custodian of the food waste element of sustainable development goal 12.3, which commits member states to halve their per capita food waste at the consumer retail level. developing the food waste index, unep is currently conducting global modelling of food waste data and preparing a harmonized methodology that will enable countries to track progress towards goal 12.3.

in december 2019, the xinhua news agency reported the seizure of over 10 tonnes of pangolin scales in the eastern chinese city of wenzhou, zhejiang province. this was the largest seizure of pangolin scales by chinese customs officials up to that point in 2019. the pangolins in question were reported to be african tree pangolins.
“this is both good and bad news,” says doreen robinson, a wildlife expert with the united nations environment programme (unep). “one the one hand it indicates a serious effort on the part of the government of china to tackle wildlife crime, on the other it shows that large quantities of trafficked pangolins are still reaching the country.”
at the same time, china has taken steps to make it more difficult to sell pangolin scale medicines: since august 2019, they are no longer covered by chinese medical insurance. “this may dampen demand for pangolin scales and other body parts used in traditional medicine,” says robinson.
pangolin trafficking topped wildlife crimes in 2019 in malawi, according to the xinhua news agency. local media reports, it said, indicate that the first successful convictions for pangolin trafficking in the sub-saharan country took place in november 2017.
meanwhile, six international airline companies will be taking the message of pangolin conservation to the skies this year. british airways, swiss international air lines, lufthansa, austrian airlines, tap air portugal and klm have all committed to screening the groundbreaking documentary, eye of the pangolin, on their long-haul routes, according to pangolin africa.







“illegal wildlife trafficking is the fourth most lucrative global crime after drugs, humans and arms, and is directly contributing to the biodiversity emergency,” says lisa rolls, coordinator of unep’s wild for life campaign.








“world pangolin day on 15 february is an opportunity for people around the world to join together in raising awareness about these unique mammals—and their plight,” says rolls.

Time is running out for coral reefs: new report","https://www.flickr.com/photos/unep/albums/72157717386673737, https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/projections-future-coral-bleaching-conditions-using-ipcc-cmip6-models-climate, https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/fate-corals-hangs-balance, https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/fate-corals-hangs-balance, https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/marine-plastic-new-and-growing-threat-coral-reefs, https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/marine-plastic-new-and-growing-threat-coral-reefs, https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/marine-heatwaves-kill-corals-quicker-previously-thought, https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/marine-heatwaves-kill-corals-quicker-previously-thought, https://www.glowing.org/, https://tinyurl.com/y85m4ct8","in 2014, coral reefs around the world turned a pallid white from heat stress. the bleaching began in the pacific and rapidly spread across the indian and atlantic oceans. the so-called third global bleaching event lasted for 36 months, marking the longest, most pervasive and destructive coral bleaching incident ever recorded.
though over now, the world’s reefs remain in hot water.
a new united nations environment programme (unep) report says worldwide mass bleaching events, like the one that began in 2014, could become the norm in the coming decades. the report’s updated climate models demonstrate that coral bleaching is happening faster than anticipated and the future health of the world’s reefs is inextricably tied to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. time is of the essence for marine species, human livelihoods and the still unknown treasures in our vastly unexplored oceans, the report said.








“the sad part is that the projections are even more dire than before,” says the report’s lead author, ruben van hooidonk,








a coral researcher with america’s national oceanic and atmospheric administration’s cooperative institute for marine and atmospheric studies. “it means we really need to try to reduce our carbon emissions to save these reefs. this report shows that we need to do it even more urgently and take more action because it’s even worse than what we thought.”
the new report, projections of future coral bleaching conditions using ipcc cmip6 models, was published in november. it examines bleaching based on two possible scenarios. the first looks at a world economy heavily driven by fossil fuels. the second explores a “middle-of-the-road” option whereby countries exceed their current pledges to limit carbon emissions by 50 per cent. (this would still lead to more than 2°c warming by century’s end.)
under the fossil-fuel-heavy scenario, the report estimates that every one of the world’s reefs will bleach by the end of the century with annual severe bleaching occurring on average by 2034, nine years ahead of predictions published three years ago. should countries achieve the middle-of-the-road scenario, severe bleaching gets delayed by eleven years, to 2045.
“in the face of inaction, coral reefs will soon disappear,” says leticia carvalho, head of the marine and freshwater branch at the unep. “humanity must act with evidence-based urgency, ambition and innovation to change the trajectory for this ecosystem, which is the canary in the coalmine for climate’s impact on oceans, before it’s too late.”

high ocean temperatures are one of the primary triggers of coral bleaching. when waters get too warm, corals release their algal energy source and turn white. corals can recover from bleaching if conditions improve. however, progressive warming events may weaken reefs beyond repair. there have been three major global bleaching events since 1998, including the one in 2014. if those become an annual occurrence, the report says it would mark the point of no return for reefs, compromising their ability to supply a range of ecosystem services, including food, coastal protection, medicines and recreation opportunities. crucially, reefs support about 25 percent of all marine species upon which at least 1 billion people depend.
coral reefs experience a huge variation in the timing and location of severe bleaching. reefs just tens of kilometers apart can display very different “average summer temperatures, bleaching thresholds and projected rates of temperature increase,” says the report.

some reefs are expected to be what the report dubs “climate losers” by experiencing severe bleaching events before 2030. widespread bleaching is already familiar to many territories, including fiji, new caledonia, saudi arabia, papua new guinea and eastern australia. other places, such as indonesia, western australia, the bahamas, madagascar, india and malaysia, contain pockets of corals only expected to bleach after 2044. reefs demonstrating this type of lower climate vulnerability could serve as “temporary refugia”, says the report.
“these are the spots where corals will survive the longest and where we should focus conservation and restoration efforts,” says van hooidonk.
despite the ocean covering much of earth’s surface, we are still only now discovering what lies beneath the sea. in october, researchers discovered a coral reef the height of the empire state building in australia. scientists estimated the reef’s deepest layer to be 20 million years old, according to media reports.

corals are tenacious animals. they’ve been around for hundreds of millions of years and have adapted to climactic change. while we don’t know exactly how corals acclimate to changing temperatures, the report examines the possibility of these adaptations assuming between 0.25°c and 2°c of warming. it also found that every quarter degree of adaption leads to a possible seven-year delay in projected annual bleaching. that means corals could receive a 30-year reprieve from severe bleaching if they can adapt to 1 °c of warming. however, if humanity keeps up with its current greenhouse gas emissions, corals won’t survive even with 2°c of adaptation.
“what this shows is even with the adaptation, we need to reduce our emissions to buy time for those locations (where) we can do restoration efforts and keep corals alive,” says van hooidonk.
 
the united nations environment programme (unep) works with other institutions to enable ecosystem-based approaches to coral reef management while providing regional- and national-level policy support. as well, it leads projects to facilitate the adoption of reef-friendly practices and helps countries build their capacity to safeguard corals. unep’s glowing gone campaign is also helping to raise awareness about the plight of corals. to learn more about how you can help save these vibrant ecosystems, visit: www.glowing.org.

The future is circular: what biodiversity really means","https://ipbes.net/global-assessment, https://ipbes.net/global-assessment, https://www.cbd.int/post2020/, https://www.un.org/en/coronavirus, https://www.unenvironment.org/unga","subtle shifts aren’t good enough, says doreen robinson, chief of wildlife at the united nations environment programme (unep). it’s time for a system-wide transformation. on the day of the un summit on biodiversity, robinson explains where we’ve gone wrong and how we can do better.
why are we talking about biodiversity now – in the midst of a global disease pandemic, with economies stretched to their limits and a looming climate crisis? 
as we speak, more species are threatened with extinction than ever before. extreme weather events – and consequently, fires, floods and droughts – are happening more frequently and with greater intensity; and zoonotic diseases like covid-19 now account for the majority of infectious diseases emerging in humans.
these are symptoms of a systemic problem, and this requires a systemic solution. we need to completely recalibrate our relationship to nature – and we need to do so, urgently.   biodiversity is the foundation for all life on earth.
how does biodiversity affect the actual experiences of people in their everyday lives?
biodiversity affects just about every aspect of human life, from job security and basic health to saving the planet for future generations.
more than half of the world’s gross domestic product (gdp) is dependent on nature. three-quarters of all food crop types – including fruits and vegetables and some of the most important cash crops, like coffee and almonds – require animal pollination. about half of the global population relies mainly on natural medicines and most of the drugs used to treat cancer are either natural or modelled after nature. so there is a direct and relationship between biodiversity and some very basic aspects of survival. 
there is also an important long-term, preventive aspect – which we are experiencing very acutely today.  where native biodiversity is high, for example, the infection rate for some zoonotic diseases is lower.  so protecting natural habitats and wildlife is also a way to help protect ourselves.  biodiversity is the basis for healthy ecosystems as well, and healthy ecosystems capture and store greenhouse gases and mitigate climate change, whereas damaged ecosystems release carbons and add to it.
when we work with nature, it works with us. and when we work against nature, we dismantle the very system that supports and protects us.
what exactly do you mean when you say “recalibrate our relationship to nature”?
human actions have typically been shaped by a paradigm in which a “good life” means material consumption and perpetual economic growth. for decades, we have extracted natural resources, destroyed critical habitats, and generated pollution.  our relationship with nature is unbalanced: humans are continuously taking and discarding, and nature is continuously giving.  this one-way relationship is unsustainable.
so we need to reset the balance: not just hoarding benefits, but investing as much back into nature as we extract from it. it’s time to develop a new paradigm that recognizes the value of nature and understands that life quality is not purely a matter of gdp. instead of a linear approach in which things are used and discarded, we need to apply circular thinking in which life is sustained and things are continuously repurposed.  we need to think about these things in all the choices we make, from how we select and deliver the food we grow and eat to how we build our cities and provide water and electricity for our growing human population.







this systemic problem requires a systemic solution.  we need to recalibrate our relationship with nature.




doreen robinson, unep chief of wildlife







in the context of global challenges we now face, and with so many jobs and industries dependent on traditional economic models, is this kind of dramatic change possible?
not only is it possible, but it is also our only hope.
aside from the unprecedented global challenges we are experiencing, biodiversity loss is making it difficult to ensure even the most basic human rights – nutritious food, clean water and affordable energy. it is undermining progress toward the sustainable development goals. and without a fundamental shift in our approach, we are unlikely to keep global warming within safe limits – a failure that would only magnify the challenges we face in the future.
it might seem counter-intuitive but, actually, now is the time to get serious about – precisely because of the challenges on our doorstep.  in times of uncertainty, biodiversity is a form of insurance, availing options and protecting us from shocks.
it also creates opportunities for new jobs, innovations – and better, healthier lives. and by prioritizing resource-intensive sectors in the shift toward sustainable consumption and production, we have the potential to achieve very significant gains over a relatively short period.
what does this mean in a practical sense: what specific actions need to be taken?
this means translating good intentions into concrete action.
as countries around the world launch various post-crisis initiatives and stimulus packages, we must include nature as part of those recovery packages.  that means natural capital must be included in decision making.  it means investing in green jobs including in areas of ecosystem protection and restoration.  now is the time to establish new,nature-positive standards for production and consumption. and we need to invest in the environment dimensions of integrated one health approaches to avoid future pandemics and other human health crises.  we can build back better – but only if we match words with deeds.
at the same time, we cannot afford to lessen our commitments to securing a new, ambitious and accountable post-2020 global biodiversity framework that all of society can support.   
channel long-term financing and investment toward nature and climate health.  currently, governments around the world spend more than us$500 billion every year in ways that harm biodiversity, primarily to support industries like fossil fuels, agriculture and fisheries.  these funds could be repurposed to incentivise regenerative agriculture, sustainable food systems, clean technology and nature-positive innovations.

Green pandemic recovery essential to close climate action gap – UN report","https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020, https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020, https://www.unep.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2020/, https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/, https://tinyurl.com/y4lsv5n8, https://www.unep.org/events/webinar/emissions-gap-report-2020-webinar","green pandemic recovery can bring 2030 emissions close to levels needed for 2°c goal, with more needed for 1.5°c goal
pandemic-linked fall in 2020 emissions of up to 7% will have negligible impact on climate change
new net-zero pledges welcome, but need to be reflected in countries’ commitments under the paris agreement and backed with rapid action 
nairobi, 9 december 2020 – a green pandemic recovery could cut up to 25 per cent off predicted 2030 greenhouse gas emissions and bring the world closer to meeting the 2°c goal of the paris agreement on climate change, a new un environment programme (unep) report finds.
unep’s annual emissions gap report 2020 finds that, despite a dip in 2020 carbon dioxide emissions caused by the covid-19 pandemic, the world is still heading for a temperature rise in excess of 3°c this century.
however, if governments invest in climate action as part of pandemic recovery and solidify emerging net-zero commitments with strengthened pledges at the next climate meeting – taking place in glasgow in november 2021 – they can bring emissions to levels broadly consistent with the 2°c goal.
by combining a green pandemic recovery with swift moves to include new net-zero commitments in updated nationally determined contributions (ndcs) under the paris agreement, and following up with rapid, stronger action, governments could still attain the more-ambitious 1.5°c goal.




“the year 2020 is on course to be one of the warmest on record, while wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc,” said inger andersen, unep’s executive director. “however, unep’s emissions gap report shows that a green pandemic recovery can take a huge slice out of greenhouse gas emissions and help slow climate change. i urge governments to back a green recovery in the next stage of covid-19 fiscal interventions and raise significantly their climate ambitions in 2021.”

each year, the emissions gap report assesses the gap between anticipated emissions and levels consistent with the paris agreement goals of limiting global warming this century to well below 2°c and pursuing 1.5°c. the report finds that in 2019 total greenhouse gas emissions, including land-use change, reached a new high of 59.1 gigatonnes of co2 equivalent (gtco2e). global greenhouse gas emissions have grown 1.4 per cent per year since 2010 on average, with a more rapid increase of 2.6 per cent in 2019 due to a large increase in forest fires.
as a result of reduced travel, lower industrial activity and lower electricity generation this year due to the pandemic, carbon dioxide emissions are predicted to fall up to 7 per cent in 2020. however, this dip only translates to a 0.01°c reduction of global warming by 2050. meanwhile, ndcs remain inadequate.
green recovery critical
a green pandemic recovery, however, can cut up to 25 per cent off the emissions we would expect to see in 2030 based on policies in place before covid-19. a green recovery would put emissions in 2030 at 44 gtco2e, instead of the predicted 59 gtco2e – far outstripping emission reductions foreseen in unconditional ndcs, which leave the world on track for a 3.2°c temperature rise.
such a green recovery would put emissions within the range that gives a 66 per cent chance of holding temperatures to below 2°c, but would still be insufficient to achieve the 1.5°c goal.
measures to prioritize in green fiscal recovery include direct support for zero-emissions technologies and infrastructure, reducing fossil fuel subsidies, no new coal plants, and promoting nature-based solutions – including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation.
so far, the report finds, action on a green fiscal recovery has been limited. around one-quarter of g20 members have dedicated shares of their spending, up to 3 per cent of gdp, to low-carbon measures.
there nonetheless remains a significant opportunity for countries to implement green policies and programmes. governments must take this opportunity in the next stage of covid-19 fiscal interventions, the report finds.
the report also finds that the growing number of countries committing to net-zero emissions goals by mid-century is a “significant and encouraging development”. at the time of report completion, 126 countries covering 51 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions had adopted, announced or were considering net-zero goals.
to remain feasible and credible, however, these commitments must be urgently translated into strong near-term policies and action and reflected in ndcs. the levels of ambition in the paris agreement still must be roughly tripled for the 2°c pathway and increased at least fivefold for the 1.5°c pathway.
reforming consumption behaviour critical
each year the report also looks at the potential of specific sectors. in 2020, it considers consumer behaviour and the shipping and aviation sectors.
the shipping and aviation sectors, which account for 5 per cent of global emissions, also require attention. improvements in technology and operations can increase fuel efficiency, but projected increases in demand mean this will not result in decarbonisation and absolute reductions of co2. both sectors need to combine energy efficiency with a rapid transition away from fossil fuel, the report finds.
the report finds that stronger climate action must include changes in consumption behaviour by the private sector and individuals. around two-thirds of global emissions are linked to private households, when using consumption-based accounting.
the wealthy bear greatest responsibility: the emissions of the richest one per cent of the global population account for more than twice the combined share of the poorest 50 per cent. this group will need to reduce its footprint by a factor of 30 to stay in line with the paris agreement targets.
possible actions to support and enable lower carbon consumption include replacing domestic short haul flights with rail, incentives and infrastructure to enable cycling and car-sharing, improving the energy efficiency of housing and policies to reduce food waste.

over 18 million hectares have burned in the australian bushfire season 2019–2020 as of mid-january according to media reports, destroying over 5,900 buildings including over 2,800 homes. in addition to human fatalities, many millions of animals are reported to have been killed.

after initial devastation of the fires, impacts are ongoing. an estimated billion animals, and many more bats and insects, are likely to die in total over the coming weeks and months as a result of lost habitat and food sources. this loss is part of a much bigger picture of a world where biodiversity is in steep decline. we are losing wildlife at an ever-increasing scale across the planet, with impacts to ecosystems vital for our own global food production. the world’s terrestrial biodiversity is concentrated in forests: they are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. so, when forests burn, the biodiversity on which humans depend for their long-term survival also disappears in the inferno. with over 1 million species currently facing extinction if we continue with business as usual, extreme weather events such “megafires” become an increasing matter of concern for species survival.

as a result of intense smoke and air pollution stemming from the fires, in january 2020 reports indicated that canberra measured the worst air quality index of any major city in the world. wildfires produce harmful smoke which can cause fatalities. wildfires produce fine particle air pollution, which is directly threatens human health even during relatively short exposures. close to the fires, smoke is a health risk because it contains a mixture of hazardous gases and particles that can irritate the eyes and the respiratory system. the effects of smoke exposure and inhalation range from eye and respiratory tract irritation to more serious disorders, including reduced lung function, bronchitis, exacerbated asthma and premature death. exposure to particulate matter is the main public health threat from short-term exposure to wildfire smoke. according to the world health organization, older people, people with cardiorespiratory diseases or chronic illnesses, children, and people who work outdoors are particularly vulnerable.

smoke from wildfires can travel great distances. it is often pushed into the stratosphere by the heat from fires. smoke from bushfires in australia has drifted across the pacific and may have reached the antarctic, according to the world meteorological organization. this has led to hazardous air quality in major cities throughout australia, and affected new zealand and cities in south america after smoke reached both argentina and chile.

fires do not only cause physical harm; many people experience mental trauma from the experience of emergency evacuation and losing homes, pets, belongings, livestock or other sources of livelihoods. some communities found themselves unable to evacuate quickly when lost electricity meant fuel stations weren’t operational or blocked roads kept people trapped in high risk areas. some were forced to seek safety on beaches and on boats, sheltering children overnight while witnessing unprecedented firestorms. such experiences can have lasting mental health impacts across affected communities.

the price tag to the australian economy is still being analyzed, but it’s clear that infrastructure has been damaged and that impacts extend to industries such as farming and tourism. some businesses and institutions have been forced to close their doors during periods of excessive levels of air pollution.

the bushfires have not only been made more likely and intense by climate change, they also add to it. until the 2019–2020 australian bushfire season, the forests in australia were thought to reabsorb all the carbon released in bushfires across the country. this would mean the forests achieved net zero emissions. however, global warming is making bushfires burn more intensely and frequently and the 2019–2020 bushfires have already emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to the copernicus monitoring programme. this is as much as australia's average annual carbon dioxide emissions in just the past three months. these will increase australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, and heighten the likelihood of recurring megafires that will release yet more emissions. this is a deeply concerning climate feedback loop.

ash from the fires has landed in school playgrounds, backyards, and is being washed up on australia’s beaches and into freshwater stores and water catchments. drinking water catchments are typically forested areas, and so are vulnerable to bushfire pollution. bushfire ash contains nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous. increased nutrient concentrations can stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae. cyanobacteria produce chemicals which may cause a range of water quality problems, including poor taste and odour, and sometimes toxic chemicals. during a blaze, plumes of smoke, ash and other debris catch on the wind and scatter across the landscape. sometimes they blow over the ocean, where they add nutrients. when burned soils flow into streams and rivers, they fertilize water plants and algae. the extra nutrients can have benefits in moderation but too much can over-fertilize and cause excess algal growth. algae absorb oxygen in the water in order to grow, and deplete dissolved oxygen when they die and decompose, which can asphyxiate fish and other marine life, with localized impacts to biodiversity. the same can be true in ocean environments, where smoke has shown to have a negative impact on marine ecosystems in several past incidents: haze from record wildfires in indonesia killed coral reefs in the late 1990s, according to a study in science, as iron-rich smoke billowed out over the coast and fertilized the water, causing a huge plankton bloom. the resulting so-called red tide asphyxiated coral reefs around the mentawai islands, off southwest sumatra.

the bushfires have scorched pasture, destroyed livestock and razed vineyards, with regrowth and recovery likely to stretch water resources already challenged by drought. reports indicate that the country’s dairy supply will likely be hit hardest, with victoria and new south wales—australia’s key milk-producing states—suffering the greatest loss of farmland and infrastructure damage. meat, wool, and honey output may also be impacted. about 13 per cent of the national sheep flock is in regions that have been significantly impacted and a further 17 per cent in regions partially impacted, according to meat & livestock australia. the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) in their 2019 report on climate change and land found that climate change has already affected food security and the agriculture industry due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, and greater frequency of some extreme events (high confidence). in some dryland areas, increased land surface air temperature and evapotranspiration and decreased precipitation amount, in interaction with climate variability and human activities, have contributed to desertification. these areas include australia.

while australians are reported to have been subject to misinformation campaigns and targeted attempts to undermine the link between climate change and more intense bushfires, this bushfire season has given australians, and the watching world, an insight into the humanitarian, ecological and economic catastrophes of a changing and warming climate. the united nations environment programme (unep) and other members of the united nations family will continue to use its digital platforms to share accurate information and facts about the science of climate change and how it is increasing the likelihood and intensity of extreme—and tragic—weather events like this.

Iceland, a world leader in clean energy, supports Africa's push for geothermal power","https://orkustofnun.is/gogn/unu-gtp-40-ann/UNU-GTP-40-A-1-Meseret-Teklemariam.pdf, https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS, https://theargeo.org/, https://nea.is/the-national-energy-authority/news/unu-gtp-parts-ways-with-unu-and-joins-unesco, https://www.unenvironment.org/about-un-environment-programme/funding-and-partnerships/funding-facts/environment-fund, https://www.unenvironment.org/about-un-environment-programme/funding-and-partnerships/funding-facts/environment-fund#:~:text=The%20Environment%20Fund%20is%20our,dimensions%20of%20the%202030%20Agenda., https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/22252/UNEP-EA-4-INF-11-VISC-FINAL.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","at the beginning of the 20th century, iceland was one of europe's poorest countries, its people relying on a precarious and polluting mix of imported coal and local peat for electricity.
but over the next century, the island nation would pull off one of the great energy makeovers in history, casting off fossil fuels and embracing geothermal power. today, nearly 100 percent of iceland's electricity comes from renewable sources, a transformation that has helped make its 366,000 people some of the wealthiest in europe.
for the last decade, iceland has been working with the united nations environment programme (unep) to spark a similar energy revolution in eastern africa. iceland has done everything from financing exploration projects to training future geothermal engineers.
""we are a small country, but we try to focus our efforts in certain areas and this is one of them,"" said guðmundur ingi guðbrandsson, iceland's minister of the environment and natural resources. he called the country’s partnership with unep “fruitful”.




harnessing geothermal energy means harnessing the heat from within the earth, which is carried by water or steam onto the surface. there are many ways in which the hot water can be released – through geysers, hot springs, steam vents, underwater hydrothermal vents – and they are all potential sources of geothermal energy.
iceland, a pioneer in the use of geothermal energy, is home to more than 200 volcanoes and a large number of hot springs, and therefore has an abundant source of hot, easily accessible underground water. this is converted to energy both for power generation and direct use applications.
in iceland, hot water and steam were long used for bathing. but in 1928, drilling for hot water began in the capital, reykjavik. today, about 90 per cent of icelandic households are heated with geothermal energy. photo by pixabayhalf a world away, east african countries are sitting atop a similar bounty. they line the great east african rift system, a 6,500-kilometre depression that stretches from northern syria to central mozambique. the rift is a hub of tectonic activity. along much of its length, heat from the interior of the earth bursts to the surface. it’s estimated that if eastern africa could harness that energy, it could generate 20 gigawatts of electricity. that is significant in a region plagued by energy shortages, where – depending on the country – 25 to 89 percent of the population did not have access to energy in 2018.
iceland is an important partner and co-financier of the unep african rift geothermal development facility project. the effort, launched in 2010, is designed to spur geothermal investments in eritrea, ethiopia, kenya, rwanda, tanzania and uganda. between 2012 and 2019, iceland also helped seven countries in east africa develop their expertise in geothermal energy through the geothermal exploration project.
“geothermal is hundred percent indigenous, environmentally friendly and a technology that has been under-utilized for too long in the continent,” said meseret teklemariam zemedkun, energy programme manager at unep. “it is time to take this technology off the back burner in order to power livelihoods, fuel development and reduce dependence on polluting and unpredictable fossil fuels.”
iceland is also home to the geothermal training programme of the united nations university (unu-gtp). established in 1978, it has graduated more than 1,300 fellows from 100 developing countries. about 39 percent of the trainees during 1979-2016 have come from 17 african countries. this indicates a significant contribution of unu-gtp in enhancing the capacities of the region.
along with several partners, including the unep, the country is also helping to establish the african geothermal center of excellence. to be based in kenya, which has been developing geothermal power since the 1970s, the centre will help train young african geothermal scientists, engineers, drillers, technicians and financiers to ensure secured and sustainable geothermal development in africa.
in the energy sector, the partnership between iceland and unep is expanding to support women through the african women energy entrepreneurs framework. the aim is to overcome the main barriers and challenges that hinder the establishment, growth and development of women entrepreneurs in the energy sector in africa.
“iceland has been a steadfast and important partner to unep in bringing geothermal expertise to east africa,” said meseret teklemariam zemedkun. “we are proud of the partnership and the results we have achieved, and happy to be expanding the partnership to support women and youth in the energy sector.”
iceland is not only an important partner to unep because of the technical and financial support provided to energy projects. it is also one of the member states that has consistently paid their “fair share” to the environment fund of unep – thereby supporting all of unep’s work.
the environment fund and the fair share
the environment fund is the core source of flexible funds to the united nations environment programme (unep). it provides the bedrock for our work worldwide as we support countries to deliver on the environmental dimensions of the 2030 agenda. to support the environment fund, each of our 193 member states is encouraged to contribute their fair share, as represented by the ‘voluntary indicative scale of contributions’, established in 2002 by the member states themselves. the scale considers each country individually, and distributes responsibility collectively. paying the fair share matters, because investing in unep means investing in the health of the planet and its people.

New programme to support Kenya’s coast and blue economy","https://unhabitat.org/","team europe, together with the governors of six coastal counties in kenya, the ministry of devolution and the blue economy secretariat, launched the go blue initiative in kenya on march 25, 2021. the four-year programme aims to protect kenya's coastal ecosystems while creating environmentally friendly jobs in a host of industries, including recycling, tourism and small-scale fishing. it is designed to foster a ""sustainable blue economy"" in six coastal counties and generate more than 3,000 jobs for youth and women alone.
go blue has received 25 million euros in funding from the european union. four eu member states – france, germany, italy, and portugal – will provide technical expertise on economic growth, while two un agencies – the united nations environment programme (unep) and  un-habitat - will ensure that interventions are aligned with environmental conservation and urban planning goals and that the initiative helps coastal cities and communities adapt to adverse effects of climate change.
""our marine and coastal ecosystems are extremely valuable in terms of providing ecosystem services – with many people earning their livelihoods through them,"" said inger andersen, executive director of the united nations environment programme (unep). ""rather than depleting or polluting these resources, we must develop ways in which to harness and protect them.""
the push comes with maritime environments around the world, including those in kenya, facing increasing pressure from climate change and pollution.  
kenya has an abundance of untapped maritime resources along its coast. go blue will focus on helping coastal communities develop those resources in a way that is sustainable and that provides economic opportunities for women and youth. the initiative will bring inclusive, integrated and sustainable approaches to economic growth, while developing new work streams, like small-scale fisheries, waste recycling, aquaculture or tourism, and technical skills in blue economy sectors, strengthening value chains and tackling regional bottlenecks.
it will also promote coastal counties’ efforts to develop integrated approaches to land-sea planning and management with a focus on restoring key coastal and marine ecosystems. lastly, the capacity of kenya’s coast guard will be strengthened to safeguard ocean assets.
""jointly working on integrated spatial planning solutions–both on land and in water–on different levels of government and with consideration to different sectors is key to achieving a sustainable blue economy,"" said maimunah mohd. sharif, executive director of un-habitat.
go blue will be implemented in cooperation with the jumuiya ya kaunti za pwani  - kenya’s coast regional counties economic development organization – together with national ministries, such as the blue economy secretariat, ministry of agriculture and fisheries, the kenya coast guard service, ministry of interior, ministry of transport and bandari maritime academy.
un-habitat and unep will support the six counties in developing three methodologies:
an integrated, ecosystem-based land-sea planning and management framework, which will improve spatial planning
a regional land-sea vision to prioritize blue economy-related issues
mapping, data collection and analysis on spatial planning and ecosystems assessments
this will feed into each county’s gis data lab, as well as a regional gis data hub, to strengthen data collection and analysis on land use changes, urbanization and environmental change patterns, marine and coastal natural assets, and human activity (e.g. fisheries, tourism, waste). in addition, the project will support waste management, constructed wetlands, blue carbon, mangrove restoration, spatial planning and community empowerment.
the information and evidence from all activities will support replication in other kenyan towns through the initiative’s online knowledge-sharing platform and trainings. furthermore, four counties should have developed their own land-sea planning proposals as a result of the project, and six innovative activities will be funded by investors that directly contribute to the blue economy and land-sea planning.

the un general assembly adopted a resolution which – for the first time – recognized environmental crime as part of other transnational organized crimes. the adoption signified a major step forward for un environment and its partners’ efforts in raising awareness of the growing threat that environmental crime poses to peace and security, sustainable development and environmental rule of law.
it was also recognition of the work un environment has undertaken to assess the scale and impacts of environmental crime and in documenting the rise of these crimes. the resolution provides the much needed impetus to move the cooperation agreement interpol and un environment forwarded. see the resolution text here.
the european union recognises un environment’s work on addressing environmental crime
the european union parliament recently adopted a resolution on the european union action plan against wildlife trafficking. the resolution specifically welcomes un environment’s experts’ process to examine and document the current status of knowledge of crimes that have a serious impact on the environment. this process notes that the legal boundaries between different types of environmental crimes are sometimes unclear, which can reduce opportunities for effective prosecution and punishment.
the resolution further acknowledges un environment’s ‘global judges programme’ and the ‘green customs initiative’ as models to follow in enhancing member states judicial, prosecutorial and custom management capacity. adoption of the resolution follows extensive engagement and consultation between un environment and the eu parliament. a copy of the resolution can be accessed here.
combatting transnational organised crime
in a show of solidarity, un environment and interpol held a high-level event on environmental crime titled ‘convergence of threats: the rise of environmental crime and implications for peace, security and sustainable development’ at the 71st session of the un general assembly in new york on 23 september, 2016.
in december 2016, un environment and interpol published a joint strategic report on environment, peace and security titled ‘a convergence of threats’. the strategic report is available here.
report highlights:
abuse of the environment is the fourth largest criminal activity in the world. worth up to usd 258 billion, it is increasing by five to seven per cent every year and converging with other forms of international crime. it is therefore a growing threat to peace, security and stability.
environmental crime is a national priority for 80 per cent of countries surveyed in the report.
more than 60 per cent of countries also reported new crimes or new modi operandi, indicating growing sophistication and adaptation by transnational organized crime groups.
the link to other criminal activities is of particular interest: 84 per cent of  countries surveyed  reported a convergence between environmental crime and other serious crimes, including: corruption (42 per cent) counterfeiting (39 per cent) drug trafficking (36 per cent) cybercrime (23 per cent) financial crime (17 per cent).

project wisdom: interpol’s project wisdom aims to tackle the poaching of elephants and rhinos, as well as the subsequent trafficking of ivory and rhino horns. the project specifically focuses on the criminal activity taking place in africa. it also supports transcontinental investigations, as ivory and rhino horns are trafficked mainly to asian countries. project wisdom has received funds from the international fund for animal welfare (ifaw), but the bulk of its financing now comes from the wildcat foundation.
pangolins: as the most trafficked mammals, pangolins have become a highly endangered species. in some regions, they are now extinct while in others, their number is critical with a drop by up to 94 per cent of their population.

Cameroon: Entrepreneur aims to plant a billion trees to create local jobs","","to mark micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises day, which falls on 27 june, we are profiling entrepreneurs who are helping to tackle some of the planet’s most pressing environmental issues.
tabi joda grew up in the forest, spending hours playing with his friends among the trees that lined the mambila plateau between cameroon and nigeria. but as they got older, there were fewer trees to climb amid a widespread and ruinous deforestation that turned trees into timber and agricultural land into deserts.
“the scale of deforestation was shocking,” he said. “the land was bare, the water table low, wildlife had diminished, and invasive species had taken over.”
the environmental toll also carried a human one, with more and more of his childhood friends making the dangerous trip to libya in search of employment and opportunity in europe. some came back, but many did not. it was then that joda decided he had a responsibility not only to the memory of his friends but also to their community and the planet.
with the support of his parents, joda took over a large piece of family land in 2010 and launched an agroforestry business he called one billion trees for africa. and he began to plant the first of tens of thousands of trees, enlisting the youth of his community to support an endeavour that he said can demonstrate how to turn rural areas into profit centers that are also beneficial to the ecosystem as a whole.
“a forest should deliver both environmental services and economic opportunities,” said joda. “agroforesty restores the ecostem and provides livelihoods.”
tabi jodi raises awareness about tree-plantingagroforestry is a central component of the 2021-2030 un decade of ecosystem restoration: a global effort to accelerate efforts to reverse centuries of damage to forests, wetlands and other ecosystems and chart a sustainable course for the planet.
taking the next step to provide alternative livelihoods for communities living in and near forests will make these kinds of initiatives sustainable as they have complementary poverty reduction and environmental sustainability goals, said judith walcott, a programme officer with unep’s world conservation monitoring centre.
“ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education and encourage sustainable economic growth,” she said.
joda estimates that he has planted around one million trees on the land he took over, intermixed with kola nuts, cashews and avocados. he employs 20 people and envisions recruiting even more youth and women from the community to produce an entire range of value-added plant-based products emerging from the forest, from skin care products derived from avocado, kennel and castor oils, as well as supplements such as moringa powder.
“if i can create employment for 20 people, it must be possible to create many more jobs and provide a viable living that will keep our youth here and discourage them from risking their lives elsewhere,” he said. “i want to stop people from being climate refugees.”
joda has taken his initiative on the road, spending time with farmers and communities across the continent, from burkina faso all the way to uganda. among the accolades he has received for his efforts are his inclusion in 2019 as an ambassador of the african forest landscape restoration initiative. 
“i want to encourage people all over the continent to replicate what i have done in my forest,” he said. “if every person plants one tree, we could get there.”

Ecosystems and Biodiversity

Fighting fires on Indonesia’s peatlands","https://tinyurl.com/y3gxca7o","the united nations has proclaimed may 22 the international day for biological diversity to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues. as one of the world’s most valuable ecosystems, peatlands support diverse species, including orangutans. yet until recently, peatlands were drained and set ablaze for agriculture, producing an ecological catastrophe that sparked the need for change.
it’s now been three years since massive fires ravaged indonesia in one of the worst environmental disasters of our century.
the blazes in 2015 scorched 2.6 million hectares across the archipelago, and produced toxic haze that blanketed neighboring countries singapore and malaysia. thousands fell ill, and the indonesian government suffered $16 billion in economic losses – more than double the sum spent on rebuilding aceh after the 2004 tsunami, according to the world bank.
what ignited this catastrophe? more importantly, what is being done to prevent it from reoccurring?

figure 1: udeng, 45, a volunteer firefighter for the “mpa” from tumbang nusa, central kalimantan (andri tambunan)
community champions
beads of sweat trickled down udeng’s face as he hauled a heavy hose across the field during a practice drill with his fellow firefighters.
the 45-year-old father of four is from tumbang nusa, a village located in indonesia’s central kalimantan province on borneo that was an epicenter of the 2015 disaster.
“the fires were very bad,” he said. “i’m here to do my part to make sure they don’t happen again.” at the time, udeng’s kids fell ill with asthma and his wife evacuated them to a neighboring village for almost a month because their home became inhospitable.

 
figure 2: udeng's wife and child, who had to be evacuated from their home during the 2015 disaster. (andri tambunan)
spurred to action, udeng joined indonesia’s network of district-level volunteer firefighting brigades, known as “masyarakat peduli api (mpa)”, which are formed by local village heads. although indonesia’s ministry of forestry established a forest fire brigade at the national level called the “manggala agni (ma)”, its capacity is frequently overextended given its vast mandate. this makes the volunteers invaluable. yet many of them lack proper training and equipment given the informal nature of their units.
to remedy this, in may, intensive training was conducted for 66 volunteer firefighters from six of central kalimantan’s most fire-prone villages under the un environment project “generating anticipatory measures for better utilization of tropical peatlands (gambut)”, which is funded by usaid and operated by the united nations office for project services (unops).

figure 3: firefighters perform a practice drill. (andri tambunan)
the training was facilitated by highly experienced south african firefighters from the working on fire program who first came to indonesia in 2015 to assist with the disaster, and have since been collaborating with the un environment project as a key partner to increase knowledge exchange and sharing between the two southern hemisphere countries.
“teaching the technical skills is the easy part,” said trevor wilson, executive director of working on fire. “the biggest challenge is changing the way local people think about fire, so the course stresses 80 per cent fire prevention and only 20 per cent fire suppression, because the best fires are the ones that never happen.”
peat as tinderboxes
for decades, indonesia's smallholder farmers have been using fire to clear land for crops to produce commodities like palm oil, of which indonesia is now the world’s biggest producer. but intentional fires often spiral out of control, particularly during the annual dry season.
particularly problematic is when these fires ignite on peatland. peat is comprised of 90 per cent water and 10 per cent organic matter (decaying plants underwater). peat fires can thus smolder underground for weeks. they are nearly impossible to put out without heavy rains.
“peatlands need to remain underwater. if you drain them, you are left with a pile of organic materials like leaves and branches, which are extremely flammable,” said johan kieft, lead technical advisor for the un-redd programme in indonesia, an initiative by un environment, the food and agriculture organization (fao) and the un development programme (undp) to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.
of the 2.6 million hectares that burned between june-october 2015, 33 per cent occurred on peatlands. when the wildfires broke out, they were exacerbated by an el niño year that caused an unusually severe dry spell. in normal circumstances, the wildfires would have abated after a few weeks, but in 2015, they raged for months.

peat and climate change
after the 2015 crisis put a global spotlight on peatlands, indonesia responded by banning the use of fire in clearing peatlands, establishing a national peatlands restoration agency (brg), as well as pledging to restore 2 million hectares of peatlands by 2020.
the un-redd programme is working closely with indonesia to raise awareness about peatlands, given that the country is home to half of the world’s tropical peatlands.
peat is one of nature's most effective ways of taking carbon out of the atmosphere and stocking it underground, making it crucial to the fight against climate change. on the flip side, when drained and set ablaze, they can release 10 times more carbon than forest fires.
“by preserving peat, we preserve precious carbon because peat is the largest terrestrial carbon stock in the world,” said kieft.

New report explores the impact of sand and dust storms","https://www.un.org/en/coronavirus","on the launch of the report, impacts of sand and dust storms on oceans: a scientific environmental assessment for policy makers, author and university of oxford lecturer, nick middleton discusses how the dust cycle affects and interacts with other global-scale biogeochemical cycles.
what exactly are we talking about when we refer to the “dust cycle”? 
the dust cycle describes the movement of trillions of tiny particles through the earth system. sand and dust is raised by strong winds from areas of bare or sparsely vegetated ground. while some of this material falls back to the surface near the source, the smaller dust particles are carried further in the wind – sometimes thousands of kilometres – before being deposited.
each year, an estimated two billion tonnes of dust is raised into the atmosphere; and one-quarter of this reaches the oceans.
is this movement regular and predictable?
these long-distance dust flows are highly seasonal and can vary significantly from year to year.  but most dust comes from deserts and semi-deserts, and a particularly dusty area known as the dust belt stretches from the sahara across the middle east to the deserts of central and northeast asia.
the planet’s largest sources are in the sahara. much saharan dust is transported south-westward by the harmattan wind that prevails between november and april. this dust has marked effects on the north atlantic and the caribbean sea, but saharan dust also impacts the mediterranean sea and the red sea.
what role do sand and dust storms play in a healthy ecosystem?
desert dust particles consist of minerals, nutrients, and organic and inorganic matter. dust plays a role in a range of earth’s physical, chemical and bio-geological processes, and interacts with the cycles of energy, nitrogen, carbon, and water. all are necessary for earth system functions.
how do they affect ocean ecosystems? 
dust carries nutrients such as phosphorus, and trace metals—including iron, manganese, titanium, aluminium—to oceanic ecosystems, elements that are essential for all life forms. in this way, desert dust is a principal driver of oceanic primary productivity, which forms the base of the marine food web.
marine primary production also fuels the global carbon cycle via the exchange of co2 between ocean and atmosphere, so desert dust has impacts on our climate system. dust also provides some of the building blocks for coral reefs: dust particles are incorporated into coral skeletons as they grow.
desert dust also provides the primary external source of iron to offshore waters, but controls on iron aerosol solubility are poorly understood. iron is required for phytoplankton growth, but the iron must be in a form that can be used by living organisms, which is dependent partly on its solubility. hence, our understanding of how the dust cycle interacts with the iron cycle is critical for our understanding of marine productivity, and hence biodiversity in the oceans.







each year, an estimated two billion tonnes of dust is raised into the atmosphere; and one-quarter of this reaches the oceans. 








what are some of the negative effects of sand and dust storms?  
the fertilizing effect of desert dust is thought to have an impact on algal blooms, some of which can be harmful, and may contribute to sargassum seaweed mats. unusually large blooms of floating sargassum seaweed have been noted since 2011 in parts of the caribbean sea and along the atlantic coastlines of west africa and brazil. these drifting seaweed mats provide important habitat for many species in the open ocean, but close to shore, they can disrupt shipping, fishing and tourism.
potential links have also been identified between microorganisms, trace metals and organic contaminants carried in desert dust and some of the complex changes on coral reefs observed in numerous parts of the world. disease has undoubtedly been an important factor in recent coral reef declines worldwide and several of the diseases that affect corals are associated with microorganisms carried in desert dust.
a wide variety of microorganisms—including fungi, bacteria and viruses—has been found in desert dust. most of these pathogens come from dryland soils and are highly resistant to desiccation, temperature extremes, conditions of high salinity and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. they are therefore typically able to survive in the atmosphere for many days.
do sand and dust storms play a role in transporting diseases like covid-19?
we still have numerous basic questions to answer regarding these desert-derived bioaerosols. it is thought that many of the microorganisms transported in desert dust are capable of causing disease outbreaks in a wide range of organisms, both terrestrial and marine, but we have little data on specific microbes found in dust storms known to cause disease in people and animals.
how does this report contribute to existing knowledge about sand and dust storms?
while our understanding of the dust cycle has improved greatly in recent decades, large uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain. nonetheless, this knowledge has significant implications for a number of sustainable development goals ­– particularly goal 14 on life below water and goal 15 on life on land.
marking the start of the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021–2030), this report explores the impacts of sand and dust storms on oceans—their ecosystem functions, goods and services—which are potentially numerous and wide-ranging. sand and dust storms thus warrant continued careful monitoring and research.

started in 2007, the 8000 kilometre-long great green wall is an african-led initiative, spanning 11 countries, to combat land degradation, desertification and drought. climate change is having a crippling impact on the sahel, happening one and a half times faster than the global average. the region experiences droughts every two years, instead of the typical 10-year cycle.
to compound its challenges, the sahel is also dogged by poverty, rapid population growth, high unemployment rates, food shortages and insecurity.

New First of its Kind Tool Helps Avoid Global Food Waste","https://www.unep.org","london, 23 may 2014 - in a world where over 840 million go hungry every day, achieving food security goes beyond increasing global food production. better food systems and sustainable consumption and production approaches are needed to achieve food security for all.
a new tool, the think.eat.save guidance version 1.0 - released today by the united nations environment programme (unep), the food and agriculture organization of the united nation (fao)and the waste and resources action programme (wrap) as part of save food initiative and fao-unep sustainable food systems programme - provides guidance to governments, local authorities, businesses and others on designing effective food waste prevention programmes.
research shows that at least one-third, or 1.3 billion tonnes, of food produced each year is lost or wasted - an amount corresponding to over 1.4 billion hectares of cropland. even a quarter of this lost food could feed all the world's hungry people.
according to the fao, almost half of all fruit and vegetables is wasted each year. about 10 per cent of developed countries' greenhouse gas emissions come from growing food that is never eaten, and food loss and waste amounts to roughly usd 680 billion in industrialized countries and usd 310 billion in developing countries.
""food waste carries direct economic and environmental costs and depletes the natural resource base that underpins food production,"" said un under-secretary-general and unep executive director achim steiner.
""today, diets are becoming more resource-intensive, and the way we buy and consume food is changing due to industrialization, the demands of a growing middle class, and the continued impacts of the economic crisis.
this first-of-its-kind guidance document on food waste prevention provides the technical expertise and impetus needed for a wide range of actors to take advantage of existing wisdom, catalyze action, and get a head start in tackling this critical issue,"" he added.
ensuring that all the world's people have enough food is the vision of un secretary general ban ki-moon's zero hunger challenge, and unep and the fao are jointly charged under the challenge with reducing food loss and waste.
to this end, unep in partnership with fao, messe düsseldorf gmbh, wrap and others, launched think.eat.save: reduce your foodprint (www.thinkeatsave.org) - a global campaign to galvanize concerted action on food waste. in its first year, this campaign has engaged more than a million participants in awareness-raising activities, reached a diverse global network of followers, and provided a portal to showcase ideas and share resources.
the think.eat.save guidance version 1.0 presents a full journey for users of the tool, beginning with the mapping and measuring of food waste and the development of national or regional policies and measures. in-depth modules then focus on programmes for food waste prevention in households and in the food supply chain.
the guidance document provides clear and comprehensive steps on scoping, planning, delivering and measuring food waste prevention programmes and activities at national, regional, business and household level. it has been built on proven experiences around the world, including that of the united kingdom, where avoidable household food waste has been reduced by 21 per cent between 2007 and 2012.
the document published today is ""version 1.0"", to be enriched progressively as many more countries around the world begin to take on the challenge and reap the benefits of food waste reduction.
to this end, unep and fao are recruiting pilot countries and cities without existing frameworks for food waste prevention to test the think.eat.save guidance version 1.0 over the coming years. technical and strategic support will be provided to pilot countries and cities, as they initiate, define, deliver and monitor food waste prevention programmes.
the document will evolve further with the development of the food loss and waste protocol for food waste measurement to support coherent global data collection, being led by the world resources institute (wri).
this practical guide is launched in anticipation of the forthcoming committee on world food security high level panel of experts food losses and waste in the context of sustainable food systems report, which supports concerted and collective action. it also contributes to the recently agreed development of a new component to the 10 year framework of programmes for sustainable consumption and production, which will be dealing with ""sustainable food systems"".
quotes
fao
""sustainable natural resources use is a key fao priority. fighting food loss and waste is an area in which partnerships are needed to reach the goal of eradicating hunger. this calls for effective governance systems and involvement of many stakeholders. we face a world with high and volatile food prices, urbanization, and climate change where coordination of strategies to reduce food waste can make a real difference,"" said helena semedo, fao deputy director general for natural resources.
wrap
dr liz goodwin, ceo at wrap, said: ""we're delighted to see this guidance version 1.0 being published today, and to have had the opportunity to work in collaboration with unep and fao to develop it. our work has helped consumers and businesses take significant strides to prevent and reduce their food waste in the uk. we hope that by assembling guidance and best practice from around the world it will encourage more action to tackle this crucial global issue.""

to download the guidance document, please visit: www.thinkeatsave.org (from 23 may 2014)
structure of the guidance version 1.0
module 1: mapping and measuring of food and drink waste
this module enables the user to scope the problem, by quantifying what is known about food waste, where it arises, and its impacts. through mapping exercises, users can identify opportunities, barriers, and potential partners for food waste reduction. aimed at national or regional government, this provides a powerful basis for strategy development.
module 2: options for developing national or regional policies and measures for food and drink waste prevention and reduction
this module provides an overview of the mechanisms that can influence food waste, namely legislative measures, fiscal measures, information provision, and motivational strategies.
module 3: developing and implementing programmes to prevent and reduce household food and drink waste
this module focuses on two proven approaches to reducing household food waste. 1) a household and consumer engagement campaign, raising awareness, encouraging behavior change, and equipping consumers with the necessary information, tools and skills. 2) changes to product, packaging and labelling, enabling consumers to buy the right amount of food and use what they buy.
module 4: preventing and reducing food waste in the food and drink business supply chain (manufacturing, retail, hospitality and food service)
this module provides guidance both for individual businesses (strategy design, tools and examples, and measurement and reporting) and for voluntary collective action programmes, providing a framework for businesses to work collaboratively across sectors and supply chains.

more than 8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans globally, each year, adversely impacting ecosystems, biodiversity and potentially human health.
according to the jamaica’s solid waste management authority (nswma), marine litter within the country's coastal waters has significantly impacted the tourism and fisheries industries. to reverse this trend a national ban on single-use plastics was launched on january 1, 2019, with several phases.
the final phase, which applies to 24” by 24” single-use plastic bags and disposable drinking straws attached to drink boxes or pouches, began on january 1, 2021. the government has granted a six-month transition period to the private sector and has committed to increasing public education and awareness-raising activities.
a growing problem
of the 800,000 tons of residential waste, jamaica generates annually, 15 per cent is estimated to be plastics. while three-quarters of this is disposed of at legal disposal sites, the remainder often ends up in drains, rivers, gullies, beaches and, ultimately, the ocean. the plastic pollution results in flooding and damage to coastal and marine ecosystems and is creating an unhealthy environment for local populations.
plastic waste accumulates in garbage dumps in rae town. photo: unepplaces like rae town, a coastal kingston neighbourhood, suffer the most from the wave of plastic pollution that makes its way into kingston harbor. the gully that traverses the area brings even more plastic waste to the area.
unep’s caribbean sub-regional office and its international environmental technology centre have been working since 2018 with the government of jamaica and the national environment & planning agency (nepa) on a plastic waste minimization project. this project, which is funded by the japanese government with co-financing through the jamaican government, aims to further strengthen policy and enhance legal frameworks that will enable jamaica to reduce and manage plastic waste from land-based sources in an environmentally sound manner. 
focusing on policy development and public education, the project is empowering rae town citizens to find innovative solutions to the plastic problem, from creative upcycling and income-generating opportunities to environmental warden initiatives.
refuse, reuse, reduce, recycle
november 2019 saw the launch of a flagship plastic recycling pilot project. under this initiative, rae town residents were encouraged to participate in clean-up activities following the 4 r’s of: refuse, reuse, reduce, recycle.
environmental wardens have been trained in the community to prevent improper waste management and the country has received the first government-owned plastic collection truck.
“this is a significant milestone,” said ms. kashta graham, the project’s manager. “prior to this, there was no truck for collecting only plastic.”
children across the community join the plastic pledge. photo: uneprae town residents have collected 6,974 pounds of plastic from their local environment and shoreline. these hauls of “waste” are increasingly becoming new means of livelihoods.
from plant pots to playground furniture, rae town residents are repurposing plastic in collaboration with 360 recycle (a local social enterprise that manufactures and sells recycled plastic products). residents are also encouraged to participate in competitions to find new ways to re-use plastic waste to benefit the community.
edson carr, planning manager at jamaica’s national solid waste management authority says the rae town project aims to shift in how residents perceive plastic and manage plastic waste. “success will entail residents engaging in the separation of plastics from their regular waste as well as community members adopting better practices”, he said.
leading by example
businesses are also getting involved through the green business jamaica environmental stewardship programme. since the initiative started in may 2019, the seven companies and five public sector entities that are participating have made significant efforts to cut plastic pollution in their operations.
the project also recently launched an eco-rewards plastic recycling pilot with lee’s food fair, one of the largest supermarkets in the kingston metropolitan area. through the store’s customer loyalty scheme, customers earn eco-reward points for every 10 pounds of plastic they bring in to be recycled. a “no plastic” pledge board encourages people to publicly commit to reducing their consumption of plastic materials.
as jamaica, along with the rest of the world, grapples with covid-19, the plastic waste minimization project offers a ray of hope.
“the rae town project is proof that, when policy makers and the public work together, systemic and sustainable change is possible,” says kashta graham.

the global average temperature is now 1.1°c higher than at the beginning of last century. higher temperatures create, in some parts of the world, drier conditions, increasing the likelihood and intensity of wildfires, and megafires. this graph, from the intergovernmental panel on climate change’s special report on climate change and land, illustrates how wildfire risk increases with global warming:
wildfire risk increases as a result of climate change. increases in global mean surface temperature (gmst), relative to pre-industrial levels, affect wildfire resulting in risks and impacts that increase from ‘moderate’ to ‘very high’ as global temperature increases.
source:  intergovernmental panel on climate change’s special report on climate change and land, illustratesmegafires, typically defined as covering more than 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares or 400 square kilometres), are accelerated by high temperatures and drought. they are  extremely challenging to contain, usually only limited by the amount of available burnable vegetation.
by the close of 2019, brazil, the democratic republic of the congo, the russian federation and the united states all experienced megafires on what many have called unprecedented scales.
global forest watch counted over 4.5 million fires worldwide larger than 1 square kilometre in 2019. this is 400,000 more fires than 2018 and two and a half times as many as in 2001. nearly all - 96 per cent—of  the 500 most disastrous megafires of the last decade have occurred during periods of unusually hot and/or dry weather.
australia faces 10 more weeks until the end of its most concentrated fire season (december to march) and its 2019–2020 bushfire season is already on track to be one of the worst on record.

reports from australia say that over 10 million hectares (100,000 square kilometres, an area the size of england) had burned by the second week of january, leaving human fatalities and destroyed homes. an estimated billion animals are likely to have died directly or indirectly, with a high price tag to the australian economy and with impacts extending to industries such as farming and tourism.
global temperature increase has been marked by successive record summer heatwaves in australia.  the average maximum temperature across the continent was above 40°c on 11 days in the month, surpassing the previous annual record of seven, set just in 2018. only four days between 1910 and 2017 averaged more than 40°c - two in 1972 and two in 2013.
the twin weather extremes of drought and heatwaves only increase the risk of recurring catastrophic fire seasons for australia.
“megafires may well become the new normal as global temperatures continue to rise,” says niklas hagelberg, a united nations environment programme (unep) climate change expert.
“governments, companies, industry and the public in g20 countries, who are responsible for 78 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, must set targets and timelines for decarbonization,” says hagelberg. “we must embrace the potential and opportunities of a world powered by renewable energy, efficiency technologies, smart food systems and zero emission mobility and buildings.”
the reality is that this is the world we live in with 1.1oc of warming. these record temperatures, heatwaves and droughts are not anomalous, they are the beginning of a new norm.
what will things be like in a few decades when we hit 1.5oc? as fires smolder across the remains of devasted communities, and threaten yet more new ones today, as international assistance has been urgently drafted in to help australia, a well-resourced country used to seasonal bushfires, it appears that we are woefully underprepared to face our future reality.
2020 is the year that governments will meet to take stock of and increase the ambition of their commitments to climate action. it is the year that global emissions must drop by 7.6 per cent and by 7.6 per cent again every subsequent year until 2030 in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5oc.
the insight these bushfires give into the humanitarian, ecological and economic catastrophes of a changing and warming climate are a somber reckoning not just for australia but for the whole world watching.

Working on saving a sinking island","","when eritai kateibwi won the un young champion of the earth award in 2017, he was thrilled. mostly, because he wanted the award to draw attention to the plight of thousands on his sinking island. 
the thirty-two islands of kiribati are at the forefront of climate impacts. some predict that the islands could be completely under water in the next 50 years. rising sea levels have other implications, with invading salt water and receding land making it difficult to farm. 
fresh fruits and vegetables are hard to come by. imported food is often expensive and with one road running down the centre of the island, transportation to the estimated 120,428 people is cumbersome. malnutrition is the leading cause of death for children aged less than 5 years. 
but two years after winning his prize, kateibwi is already bringing about real change. his solution to the rising sea levels and lack of nutritious food has been to invent a unique hydroponic system, which uses a locally available nutrient solution to make food without soil. 
“we are really on the frontline here. i saw my community struggling to feed their families. the lack of healthy and nutritious food made my heart sink. i felt strongly that i could find a solution to this and wanted to use my technical background to achieve it.” 
two years later, kateibwi’s te maeu project has provided hundreds of families with hydroponic units supplying fresh cabbages, peppers, melons and zucchini. his colorful demonstration plots have shown farming families how to start their own garden.
“when i first heard about growing crops without soil, it was mind-blowing. the idea has taken off in europe—but we just can’t find the same kind of nutrient-dense solutions and equipment here. so, i started experimenting, and made my own fertilizer.” 
kateibwi is now on track to receive a grant from rotary international to multiply his technology. already, he is distributing 500 new units in the community. some of the families he delivers the units to are already completely under water at some times of the day. 
“the world still sees us as a sinking island, but we have to do our best when we’re afloat. i will do whatever it takes to make sure our people have access to healthy food in the meantime,” he said, adding that sharing his story and making other people aware of kiribati’s plight is critical.  
do you want to be a young champion of the earth in 2019? we encourage everyone who wants to make a difference for our planet to apply for the young champion of the earth prize, powered by covestro. apply today! the portal is open until march 31st.

the side event “technology innovation for a green economy in developing countries” was organizes jointly by the united nations environment programme (unep) and the centre for international environmental studies (cies) of the graduate institute of international and development studies in geneva, switzerland.
this side-event presented innovation policy for a green economy in several developing countries. in particular, it provided country case studies to examine the issue of accessing clean energy technology and how to contribute to the evolution of eco-innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) in developing countries. the research investigates the barriers to the diffusion of clean technologies, the governance mechanisms that can help to unlock diffusion and improve clean energy access in developing countries and required policy environment which enables eco-innovation process of smes through green technology. 
the event built on the results of a joint research project between unep and the graduate institute of international and development studies in geneva, as well as unep's project on eco-innovation and specifically the role of technology in the process of eco-innovation.
the event was opened by joy kim, senior economic affairs officer at unep's economics and trade branch (etb), who highlighted that innovation policy was identified as one of key policy tools to support green growth at the inauguration conference of the green growth knowledge platform (ggkp) in 2012, mexico. in particular, access to readily available clean technology was highlighted as a key issue in many developing countries. the unep-cies joint project specifically focuses on the barriers to readily available clean technologies, especially in developing countries.
liliana andonova, professor and co-director of the cies, emphasized that exploring these barriers is important in light of the advancement of consensus on the need for clean technologies following the cop21 and the sustainable development goals.
five speakers discussed various barriers to clean energy technologies in several developing countries and how they can best be addressed for a green economy transition. ms. suchita srinivasan, from cies, presented key policy barriers to the diffusion of fluorescent lamps across developing countries. the study shows that among others, incentives through subsidies, bans on inefficient lighting and information were effective in impacting the adoption of energy efficient lighting. the key barriers towards greater adoption of these technologies includes a lack of information and a lack of affordability. in this regard, policy mix to promote access to this technology may not be complementary.
in developing geothermal energy in indonesia, ms. kathryn chelminski from cies, highlighted that international development assistance and policy support have played a key role in filling gaps left by the private sector and government. however, there are still financial and regulatory barriers remaining and a significant need for improved policy transfer and human capacity building at multiple levels of government and in the technical workforce.
on the issue of whether tariffs constitute a barrier to green goods liberalisation, ms. jenny surbeck of the world trade institute, university of bern, presented an empirical assessment demonstrating that tariffs indeed constitutes barriers to liberalising environmental goods (egs). the study shows that egs are substantially reduced in preferential trade agreements. the average tariffs of the analysed eg lists members (apec, oecd and friends) are lower than the average tariffs for their respective eg classification.
mr. long nguyen hong, senior expert on sustainable product innovation and green production and director of centre for creativity and sustainability (ccs), presented a study which aims to understand how clean technology contributes to smes’ innovation in vietnam. the scope of industries include biomass gasification, solar heating and organic farming. the study shows in vietnam, selection of technologies, particularly ones that are linked to business models are key to the success of smes’ eco-innovation.
the key barriers to eco-innovation in peru include a lack of qualified personnel, lack of finance, and risk. as possible solutions, mr. marcos alegre, director of centre for eco-efficiency and social responsibility grupo gea, peru pointed out that there is a need for networked institutional platforms across public and private sector, development of local capacities, and improved incentives for smes.
ms. elisa tonda (unep) and ms. joelle noailly (cies, graduate institute) summarized the barriers to clean technology diffusion as found in these studies, the mechanisms to address them, and highlighted opportunities for transnational cooperation involvement in achieving these objectives.
overall the country case studies presented at the side event highlighted the following:
there is a large scope for international cooperation to fill in gaps on finance - from the creation of ideas, to the implementation, to the commercial phase of projects, knowledge and labour skills capacity that are key barriers to increased access to clean technologies in developing countries;
in both oecd and non-oecd countries, predictability and consistency of innovation policy are crucial to the diffusion of clean technologies;
creating a market environment that are conducive to innovative technologies to induce market demand is important;
the role of social learning also plays a key role in diffusion of clean technologies.

this piece was first published by food tank 
have you ever thought about what your clothes are made of? about who makes your clothes, or what happens after you donate them or throw them away? the truth about the fashion industry is actually pretty ugly.
a recent study by the ellen mcarthur foundation found that one garbage truck of textiles is wasted every second. and the copenhagen fashion summit reported that fashion is responsible for 92 million tons of solid waste dumped in landfills each year.
the fashion industry is also the second-biggest consumer of water, producing 20 percent of wastewater while also generating more greenhouse gas emissions than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. 
ahead of world environment day on june 5, themed “beat plastic pollution,” it’s worth remembering that synthetic microfiber pollution is washing up in our oceans at alarming rates. around 100,000 marine animals are killed each year by plastic waste, including microfibers.
we need to rethink our fast-fashion habit—we can’t continue to make clothes that do not consider our environment.
first, it’s up to apparel brands to take responsibility for the waste they’re creating. brands need to address chemicals, use of textiles waste and synthetic fabrics that don’t break down, and unfair working environments in the clothing industry head-on.
the no-waste economy must be applied to fashion, just as it is in the food industry. we need action at each stage of the supply chain, starting with sustainable sourcing of fabrics, through to design, exploration of possible alternatives to distribution, and recovery and recycling of clothing.
big brands are starting to take notice: nike, h&m, burberry, and gap have all recently signed up to the make fashion circular initiative. it aims to improve the industry’s record on sustainability and reduce global waste from fashion by recycling raw materials and products.
while recycling is certainly one solution, it is by no means the only solution. in fact, we should be asking a different question: how can we eliminate the need for recycling altogether? how can we design with the end in mind?  
i’m developing a take-back program for my sustainable apparel brand, novel supply co., where we accept back our apparel at the end of its life and find alternative ways to use, recycle, and compost it. but as a global community, we also need to shift the way we consume fashion.
i currently source my fabrics from a fair ware mill in china, but this is not ideal. in general, richer countries are consuming fashion that is made and produced in poorer countries. but all countries are involved in the value chain.
in countries with emerging economies, there are an estimated 2 billion new consumers waiting to buy the latest trends. we are racing against the clock to include poorer countries in more sustainable manufacturing models, so they can produce clothing locally and more sustainably.
to shift typically linear take-make-waste fashion towards a circular model with no waste, we all need to be part of the movement to innovate and redesign our fashion industry. we can start by buying clothes with the circular economy in mind.
it’s up to us as consumers to trigger change by voting with our wallets. the average number of clothing collections in europe more than doubled between 2000 and 2011: we are buying more clothes and wearing them less.
our fast-fashion habit is expensive. more than us$500 billion in value is lost every year due to under-utilized clothes and lack of recycling. we as consumers need to educate ourselves about circular fashion: we need to buy less clothing and when we do, we need to make sure that is more sustainable and higher quality. we also need to demand transparent sourcing.
it will take time for the fast-fashion industry to slow down. the trends already set in motion by the make fashion circular initiative and others are starting to gather steam. but to stop stretching our planet, we all need to play our part.
consume consciously and responsibly by reading the labels before you purchase. be sure to look for natural and organic fibers, non-toxic dyes, take-back programs, and ethical production.

Seeing the light: LEDs power India’s drive for household energy-efficiency","https://www.eeslindia.org/, https://unfccc.int/, https://www.adb.org, https://www.thegef.org/, https://www.eeslindia.org/","how many people does it take to change a light bulb? so begins the old joke, but the more serious question for india’s energy efficiency services ltd was how many people need to switch to energy-efficient light bulbs in order to reduce the nation’s carbon footprint?
india‘s population of over 1.3 billion makes it the second largest nation in the world, so reducing the country’s greenhouse gas emissions is a sizeable challenge. as part of its commitments under the un framework on the convention on climate change, india plans to reduce its carbon footprint by 33-35 per cent from its 2005 levels by 2030. and with the energy sector responsible for over 70 per cent of the nation’s emissions, energy efficiency is crucial to the government of india’s green ambitions. 
today, these ambitions are a step closer to reality, with the asian development bank, un environment and partners combining forces on the creating and sustaining markets for energy efficiency project, a global environment facility-supported initiative to catalyze new markets for energy-efficient products, such as led light bulbs.
raj bairwa fits a new led lightbulb at his family home in north delhi’s keshay puram neighbourhood. photo by un environment / lisa murraythe project is backing indian public-private venture energy efficiency services ltd to expand the market for led domestic lighting and street lighting, while providing the expertise necessary to pilot new technologies such as energy-efficient ceiling fans, tri-generation technologies and smart metres.
in a ramshackle street in keshav puram in north delhi, raj and mamta bairwa are pioneering the switch to more efficient lighting. within their low-income neighbourhood, electric cables and water pipes intertwine across rooftops and dangle over backyards. here, the couple lives with their six children, aged two to twelve. they used to fit compact fluorescent light bulbs in their household but found the light quality to be dim and the lifespan short. once they had tried the led bulbs, there was no turning back.
“the previous bulbs used to heat up the room a lot,” explains mamta. “but this one [the led bulb] is a lot lighter and cooler, and the energy consumption of is comparatively low.” 
a lower energy bill amounts to a light at the end of the tunnel for mamta, whose husband has struggled to find steady work and had to rely on casual labour for an income. 




“the price of the bulbs is lower and they help us reduce our electricity bills. we used to get a 500 rupee energy bill and now it’s 350 rupees – saving 150-200 rupees a month,” she says happily. this additional money is now directed towards their dream of helping their daughters become financially independent, educated adults in later life. 
but why have families like the bairwas only just started using energy-saving light bulbs? 
previously, the cost of led bulbs was prohibitive at 400 rupees each. with support from the global environment facility, energy efficiency services ltd were able to leverage the power of demand aggregation, buying the bulbs in large quantities and reducing the cost for consumers to only 70 rupees per bulb – making leds even cheaper than the less-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs (as well as greener and more cost-effective). the knock-on effect at industry level has been substantial. recognizing a growing market, manufacturers have increased led production, bringing down prices even further. 
mamta and raj bairwa are enthusiastic about their switch to led lighting: “the price of the bulbs is lower and they help us reduce our electricity bills.”  photo by un environment / lisa murraybefore energy efficiency services ltd entered the market four years ago, led bulbs represented just 10-15 per cent of indian lighting. today, leds have taken poll position in the market – cornering 75 per cent of sales, against just 15 per cent for compact fluorescent bulbs. 
so far, energy efficiency services ltd have distributed over 300 million led bulbs, with the aim of replacing 770 million compact fluorescent bulbs in total by march 2019. but the creating and sustaining markets for energy efficiency project is also reaching far beyond domestic lighting. by developing viable business models and fronting capital to prove their value, the project is strengthening markets for many other game-changing energy-efficient technologies. the revolving fund is set to include street lighting, five-star-rated ceiling fans, agricultural pumps, smart grids and tri-generation systems. overall, the project aims to bring about direct energy savings of 38.3 million gigajoules by 2022 and 137.5 million gigajoules by 2032 – equivalent to 23.3 million barrels of oil, reducing india’s carbon footprint by 60 million tons of co² equivalent.
another element of the partnership to spark illuminating results is the street light national programme, launched in january 2015. energy efficiency services ltd have replaced conventional street lighting with automated led alternatives in 24 of india’s 29 states, and three of its seven union territories. while the costs of this refitting have been covered by energy efficiency services ltd, the savings each municipality reaps from decreased energy consumption and reduced need for maintenance will be used to repay the investment over time. 
so far, 6.35 million led streetlights have been installed, along with automatic systems to control them. these are an improvement on the manual controls previously used, which had greater potential for energy wastage. the new lighting is not only brighter, making the streets safer for women walking at night, but it is also saving over four billion kwh per year, amounting to a potential reduction of almost three million tonnes in in co² emissions.
energy savings are helping the bairwa’s fund their daughters’ education, lighting the way to a brighter future for the family. photo by un environment / lisa murrayin a country which celebrates light each year with the joyful diwali festival, it is fitting that efficient lighting systems are becoming more affordable and accessible. by covering the initial cost of energy-efficient technologies and reducing the risks involved in proving their commercial viability, the project looks set to continue its success in making such products affordable and marketable for businesses.
for mamta and raj, it is a simple matter of giving their children the best chance of a brighter future through improved lighting.
 “the most important thing is that the kids can study better,” mamta says. “education cannot be compromised with low-quality light.”
creating and sustaining markets for energy efficiency is a five-year global environment facility supported project aiming to increase energy efficiency across india through the promotion of efficient technology such as led lighting, super-efficient ceiling fans, smart grids and tri-generation systems.

Local treasures: Nepal’s mountain crops drive biodiversity and economic growth","https://www.bioversityinternational.org/alliance/, https://ipbes.net/news/global-assessment-summary-policymakers-final-version-now-available, https://tinyurl.com/ybbuy5zk, https://tinyurl.com/yyvrtzp6, https://tinyurl.com/y93ykblv","remote mountainous regions of nepal are harsh places in which to survive and make a living.
economic, social and environmental challenges include lack of market access, outmigration, dependency on imports and subsidies, women’s drudgery, malnutrition, unpredictable weather, pests and diseases.
to tackle some of these challenges, unep and partners are working with the local community to conserve biodiversity of crops, to boost food security and resilience.
the 2014-2020 global environment facility-supported project was implemented by the united nations environment programme (unep) and executed by bioversity international in collaboration with national  partners—the nepal agricultural research council, the department of agriculture, and local initiatives for biodiversity, research and development.

“the project is truly for the community, by the community,” says manoela pessoa de miranda, a unep biodiversity expert. “it is helping improve food security and livelihoods, while bringing people together to conserve agrobiodiversity.”








new tools
the project faced two major hurdles in five years: devastating earthquakes in march and april 2015, which badly affected two of the four sites, as well as a major administrative reform which saw the introduction of a new federal system in 2017.
despite the disruptions, government officials believe the project has made a difference. “the project has developed the foundation for promoting and mainstreaming traditional crops,” says deepak bhandari, executive director of the nepal agricultural research council. he also hailed the launching of the national project website.
women receive millet machine in humla. photo by d. gauchan/ bioversity international “the project made us aware of the value of local crops,” says depsara upadhaya, a farmer from chhipra village in the northwest of nepal. “we received support to establish a community seedbank in the village, and electric machines were made available to process finger and proso millet. this brought great relief to women in my village by reducing the physical strain of manual threshing.”
under the project, four community seed banks were established to conserve rare, local mountain crops. the banks now conserve 232 unique and endangered varieties of 56 crops. unep and partners also encouraged best practices for mainstreaming agrobiodiversity in agriculture through community biodiversity management funds, farmers’ field schools and seed exchanges.
making a difference




“crop biodiversity contributes to nature, which is an essential source of many drugs used in modern medicine. globally, nearly half of the human population depends on natural resources for its livelihood,” says unep biodiversity expert marieta sakalian.
since its inception in 2014, the project has been boosting mountain crop biodiversity for the benefit of local communities and farmers. results include:
20,000 households received seeds, germplasm and information on how to conserve and grow mountain crops.
300 germplasms of eight target crops were sent to project sites for on-farm testing. over 60 were selected for use by farmers.
500 local crop genes have been stored in the national gene bank for future breeding.
in 2019, low-interest, collateral-free loans were given to 58 farmers – mostly women - by a community biodiversity trust fund.
electric threshers for millet reduced women’s’ physical labor and improve efficiency. finger millet threshers were distributed to over 500 households. eight improved pieces of processing equipment were given to communities.
capacity building of over 100 local farmers, many of them women
over 70 publications—books, flyers, posters, blogs and brochures—were produced.
 
nature is in crisis, threatened by biodiversity and habitat loss, global heating and toxic pollution. failure to act is failing humanity. addressing the current coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and protecting ourselves against future global threats requires sound management of hazardous medical and chemical waste; strong and global stewardship of nature and biodiversity; and a clear commitment to “building back better”, creating green jobs and facilitating the transition to carbon neutral economies. humanity depends on action now for a resilient and sustainable future.

Sustainable Cities: Lessons from Nepal and Colombia","https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html#:~:text=News-,68%25%20of%20the%20world%20population%20projected%20to%20live%20in,areas%20by%202050%2C%20says%20UN&text=Today%2C%2055%25%20of%20the%20world's,increase%20to%2068%25%20by%202050., https://www.neighbourhoodguidelines.org/, https://www.thegef.org/topics/sustainable-cities","cities have always had to conform to their natural surroundings. traditional moroccan housing was designed with open air courtyards to help with ventilation in the dry and hot climate. while in iceland, turf houses covered in grass— the original “green buildings”— offered superior insulation in cold weather compared to those made only of wood or stone.
nature-based solutions have played a crucial role in cities’ design for centuries, but rapid urbanization is putting natural resources to the test.
the un estimates that over the next 30 years, an additional 2.4 billion people are likely to live in urban areas, 68 per cent of the global population in 2050, with most of this shift occurring in the global south. currently, a third of city inhabitants are estimated to live in slums and informal settlements, often without access to proper housing and basic services. poor and unplanned urbanization impact resource use, biodiversity and climate.
the united nations environment programme (unep) cities’ unit is releasing a new set of guidelines for policymakers and city practitioners for integrated and sustainable neighbourhood design with an emphasis on community needs. these guidelines aim at guiding policy development and practical application in new developments and in the regeneration of existing neighbourhoods.
“sustainable cities and communities start with sustainable neighbourhoods,” said martina otto, head of the cities’ unit at unep. “by emphasising the importance of local context, design and integration, we aim to inspire stakeholders involved in urban planning to think sustainably about the daily needs of people in their neighbourhoods. in response to the covid-19 pandemic and the climate, nature and pollution crisis, reconsidering present urban development paradigms is all the more important and mixed-use, green and interconnected neighbourhoods are a stepping stone for the needed transformation.”







""lalitpur is restoring the resilient and resource-efficient forms of urbanism on the basis of its history and local knowledge, with the goal of becoming a clean and sustainable city.""




chiri babu maharjan, mayor of lalitpur (nepal)







an eco-city in nepal
one of the cities that unep is working with is lalitpur, in nepal’s kathmandu valley. when it was built about 1720 years ago, city planners ensured that open spaces, water availability and ground water recharge were inclusive.
but urbanization and inadequate growth management deteriorated the quality of life in new neighbourhoods. today, lalitpur is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, with many residents lacking basic facilities, like water supply and sanitation, and with few green spaces.
unep is working with the city government to reinstate lalitpur as an eco-city. starting with three neighbourhoods, the consort will construct seven parks, install smart, solar lights; reduce waste to landfill; cut down open burning; and give residents access to health facilities in their neighbourhoods, among other benefits.
“lalitpur is restoring the resilient and resource-efficient forms of urbanism on the basis of its history and local knowledge, with the goal of becoming a clean and sustainable city,"" said lalitpur metropolitan city mayor, chiri babu maharjan. “we have built 4.7 km of bicycle lanes to link the northern and southern parts of the city, and installed bicycle stands in the historic patan durbar square. thanks to this, the air pollution in the city center has greatly improved, and with that, the health and well-being of our citizens.”
 
on the move in medellin
unep is also working with the city of medellin in colombia on the neighbourhood of moravian the 1960s, millions of internally displaced colombians set up homes in moravia, which at the time held the municipal landfill site. the living conditions were dangerous and many residents suffered serious health consequences from the toxic fumes.
while the neighbourhood has made many advances in sanitation and urban planning since then, city authorities are determined to do more. medellin is establishing “habitat and mobility corridors” that will simultaneously address mobility issues while creating green spaces and biodiversity. the corridors will be pathways for cyclists and pedestrians to access recreational places such as the local soccer field and cultural centres, but also provide habitats for native animals and plants. they should also have a positive impact on the microclimate by reducing heat and creating shade.
“neighbourhoods are windows for immediate action,” said andré confiado, who works on sustainable cities for unep. “they are big enough to bundle interrelated components and give way to a coherent urban fragment, yet small enough to achieve results in a foreseeable time period. the approaches suggested in unep’s integrated guidelines for sustainable neighbourhood design, and the training we propose to participating cities will contribute to the global environment facility funded sustainable cities impact programme”.

India joins the Climate and Clean Air Coalition","https://unfccc.int/news/international-solar-alliance, https://ccacoalition.org, https://ccacoalition.org","new delhi, 5 july 2019 – india has formally joined the climate & clean air coalition (ccac), becoming the 65th country to join the partnership, following through on a commitment made by the country’s newly-appointed minister for environment, forest and climate change, prakash javadekar, during last month’s world environment day celebrations. 
the announcement underlines india’s commitment to combat air pollution with a solutions-oriented approach.  
""india will work with coalition countries to adopt cleaner energy sustainable production and consumption patterns and environment-friendly transport, agriculture, industry and waste management to promote clean air,” minister javadekar said. “india has taken a lead role in combating air pollution; these activities, including bilateral and multilateral cooperation with partners, will highlight india’s initiatives and expertise in the field.""  

inger andersen, executive director of the united nations environment programme (unep), which hosts the coalition’s secretariat, welcomed india, saying: “india joining the climate and clean air coalition is a significant milestone in the global effort to improve air quality and rapidly reduce the rate of global warming.”  

india plans to work with climate clean and coalition countries on best practices and experiences for the effective implementation of india’s national clean air programme (ncap). 
launched in january 2019, the ncap is a comprehensive strategy with actions to prevent, control and reduce air pollution and improve air quality monitoring across the country. it aims to reduce fine particulate (pm2.5) and particulate (pm10) air pollution by 20 per cent–30 per cent by 2024. india has identified 102 non-attainment cities, with city-specific action plans being formulated. 
clean air and climate-friendly technologies will be at the forefront of sustainable development for all countries; india is a global leader in the development of technologies, infrastructure and policies in this field. 
in 2015, india initiated the international solar alliance, a global coalition of nations tackling climate change by leveraging the power of solar energy, and has increased its vehicle emissions standards to bs6, which is similar to euro 6 standards. in 2017, the central government announced that from 2030, all new vehicles sold in the country would be electric.
the coalition offers india a well-established and action-oriented partnership platform, which will be instrumental in the implementation of the country’s ambitious national clean air programme and will help define priorities when it comes to action on air pollution, development and climate co-benefits of it.
in addition, the coalition can support india’s efforts to develop the governance and local capacities to adopt and implement environmentally friendly technologies and solutions.
“it is with great pleasure that the ccac welcomes india as a new partner to the coalition. india joins a coalition of 64 countries that strives for better air quality, and at the same time, for the mitigation of climate change. with a population of 1.3 billion people, india is a key partner for global action on climate and clean air,” said yuka greiler, head of the global programme for climate change and environment at the swiss agency for development and cooperation and co-chair to the climate and clean air coalition. “the participation of india in the ccac will also reinforce the coalition. we very much look forward to learning from india’s experiences and to continuing to foster exchanges of experiences among our coalition partners.”
albert magalang, head of the climate change office of the philippines and co-chair of the climate and clean air coalition said: 
“joining hands with all the partner countries and organizations of ccac, it is with gladness that we welcome india as the newest partner of the coalition. india has a great story to share with the whole world in its move to beat air pollution and to mitigate climate change. india’s participation in the coalition is a great addition to the ever-growing partnership in our fight for clean air and climate change. we are looking forward to the experiences, stories, and knowledge india will impart to the coalition. again, welcome aboard, india!” 
helena molin valdés, head of the unep-hosted climate and clean air coalition secretariat, said india’s leadership and participation in the coalition would be vital to achieving the coalition goals to reduce air pollution and keep globally to 1.5 degrees celsius by 2030.
“we look forward to working with india on practical steps to reduce short-lived climate pollutants and air pollution. india is already taking the initiative through its national clean air programme and in key sectors like transportation, household energy and waste management,” ms molin valdés said. “these activities and cooperation between partners will highlight india’s leadership and international outreach in the global effort to fight air pollution and climate change.” 
the climate and clean air coalition is a voluntary global partnership of 65countries, 17 intergovernmental organizations, and 56 businesses, scientific institutions and civil society organizations committed to catalyzing concrete, substantial action to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, black carbon and many hydrofluorocarbons. 
the coalition has 11 initiatives working to raise awareness, mobilize resources and lead transformative actions in key sectors. reducing short-lived climate pollutants can provide benefits to health, development, and the environment; implementing these initiatives can prevent more than 2.5 million premature deaths from air pollution every year. these actions must go hand-in-hand with deep and persistent cuts to carbon dioxide and other long-lived greenhouse gases if we are to achieve the goal of the paris agreement and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius.

the agreement, which was signed in dushanbe on 17 september 2020 and has a five-year duration, focuses on five key areas: climate change adaptation; biodiversity conservation; monitoring of water quality; environmental assessment and sharing of knowledge and expertise on ecosystem management. it also includes a commitment by the two countries to undertake environmental impact assessments of joint projects and to notify each other in case of potential environmental impacts across borders.
“it gives us great pleasure to welcome our friends and neighbours from afghanistan in dushanbe to conclude today’s important agreement and join our hands in conserving the outstanding wildlife of our shared mountain ecosystems and help our peoples adapt to the growing impacts of climate change,” said sheralizoda ahmadjon, chairman of the committee on environmental protection of tajikistan.
the spectacular landscape of the pamir and wakhan mountains, whose glaciers give rise to the amu darya – central asia’s largest river – is home to iconic species including the endangered snow leopard, mountain goats and sheep, and endemic vegetation communities.
with the ranges’ strategic location at the crossroads of the historic silk road, the new agreement seeks to solidify the alliance between the two countries in protecting the fragile mountain ecosystem by mitigating the environmental impacts of future investment plans in infrastructure, extractives and trade, as well as supporting local communities in adapting to climate change through sustainable natural resource management practices.
discussions between the two countries first took place in 2012 under the auspices of the un economic commission for europe, which led to the endorsement of an mou on the exchange of hydrological data for the panj-amu darya in 2014. this mou has enabled the installation of hydrological stations along the over 1,000-kilometre-long shared river border between the two countries, and the exchange of water flow data. this data is critical not only for water resources management and climate adaptation, but also for flood and drought forecasting and early warning systems.    
the conclusion of a new environmental cooperation mou represents the second major milestone of this bilateral dialogue process, which unep helped facilitate, supported by the european union, under the opportunities for mountain area integrated development project.
“the agreement provides a structured framework for afghanistan and tajikistan to practically address the threats of climate change and biodiversity loss. we hope this cooperation will continue to extend to the other countries of the amu darya basin in the future,” said gary lewis, director of unep’s disasters and conflicts programme.
the mou also fulfils the commitments made by the two countries under the protocol of the 7th meeting of the intergovernmental economic, commercial, social and technical commission (july 2019) to expand their cooperation efforts to protect and sustainably manage their natural resources.
zoi environment network – a non-governmental organisation based in switzerland - also contributed to the organization of meetings and has been a long-standing partner in the afghan-tajik cooperation process.  
the new agreement also establishes a technical working group on environmental protection responsible for development and implementation of cooperative programmes and activities.
one of the first activities under the new agreement is a study tour for environmental experts from both countries to survey the environmental challenges in the panj basin – pamir mountains region – and to develop a joint environmental action plan. to facilitate knowledge exchange, unep is also supporting both countries in developing a geospatial platform to exchange environmental information.

Smart new technologies can play a vital role in addressing plastic pollution crisis in our waters – new study","https://www.unenvironment.org/, https://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/, https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/single-use-plastics-roadmap-sustainability, https://www.unep.org/resources/report/water-pollution-plastics-and-microplastics-review-technical-solutions-source-sea, https://www.unep.org/resources/report/water-pollution-plastics-and-microplastics-review-technical-solutions-source-sea, https://tinyurl.com/y7qmt7aj","nairobi/colombo, 17 december 2020 - from source to sea, our waters are contaminated by a plastics scourge. a new study by the un environment programme (unep) and the international water management institute (iwmi) offers a number of technological solutions aimed at tackling one of the world’s most pressing issues.
approximately 8 million metric tonnes of plastic litter flow to the ocean annually, and only 9% of plastic waste ever produced has been recycled. a large percentage of the rest ends up in landfills, dumps and the environment, often findings its way to rivers, lakes and oceans through runoff, leakage, flushing of disposable wipes and hygiene products.
another major issue relates to microplastics – those plastics that are smaller than 5 millimeters, and that pose increasing environmental, economic and health hazards. sometimes these are intentionally added to products, for example in cosmetics, for seed coatings, paint, washing powders and other applications. they are also generated from wear and tear, through the production of synthetic textiles and tyre usage. in addition, discarded plastics break down into these smaller particles through natural weathering processes. microplastics can enter water bodies through different pathways, including atmospheric deposition, run-off from land, roads and through municipal wastewater.
much effort has been made to both identify the scale of the threat of plastics to the health of humans, and ecosystems, along with solutions to tackle it. water pollution by plastics and microplastics: a review of technical solutions from source to sea explores a set of innovative tech solutions for use in various scenarios.
among these potential technologies include:
introducing debris-cleanup boats, debris sweepers and sea-bins to remove plastics and other wastes carried into water bodies;
protecting large bodies of water by introducing wetlands along coastlines;
secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment which relies on membrane filtration to prevent microplastics entering rivers and lakes;
advanced coagulation technology to make water contaminated with microplastics drinkable;
promoting sustainable waste management practices to reduce plastic leakage.
a key principle of this work is preventing untreated wastewater, which is often packed with plastics and microplastics, from entering the environment in the first place. the study details financially sustainable waste recycling that is socially and legally acceptable, and environmentally friendly.
“waste management in most cities of developing countries is an expensive, labor-intensive and low-margin business, which explains why a large share of the generated waste is inadequately managed. the wastewater coming from urban residential, industrial and commercial settings is full of contaminants including plastics, microplastics and other debris,” said dr. mark smith, director general of iwmi. “it is very important to reduce and remove plastic before it enters into wastewater treatment plants or freshwater bodies”.
the study, composed of a toolkit and catalogue, analyzes the most relevant technologies to improve current waste and wastewater management practices and presents both the pros and cons of applying specific solutions to mitigate levels of plastic pollution from source to sea.
“to effectively tackle the crisis of plastic pollution in our freshwater and marine ecosystems, we need innovative technologies that will serve us for years to come. we need to look at how we address waste production, waste management as well as the treatment of wastewater and run-off holistically, at source, and across sectors – a key part of building healthier, more sustainable societies,” said inger andersen, executive director of unep. “the technologies highlighted in this study should be supported by legislation, finance and awareness in order to lead to real change on the ground”.
decision makers, experts and relevant stakeholders need to come together in order and to agree on the desired water quality in their local context and a sustainable combination of solutions.
water pollution by plastics and microplastics: a review of technical solutions from source to sea is based on research funded by the united nations environment programme (unep) and the water, land and ecosystem research program of the cgiar.”

at the un general assembly in new york this week, environment minister thérèse coffey will urge other countries to back britain’s call to designate 30 per cent of the world’s oceans as marine protected areas (mpas) by 2030 in a bid to reverse the damage being done by overfishing, plastic pollution and climate change.
“it is only by working with our counterparts internationally that we can truly bring about global change,” coffey said in a statement on monday. “i am delighted to be in new york this week to look at how we can build on the progress made on marine protection and protect the world’s oceans for future generations.”
endurance swimmer and un environment patron of oceans lewis pugh said the british action was a “landmark decision” for ocean conservation.
“it took my breath away. if this is supported by other nations and followed through, it will be the most important moment for ocean conservation in history,” said the athlete, who recently swam the length of the english channel to highlight the need for the global target for ocean protection to be trebled.
""the pain of my 49 days swim has quickly disappeared."" said pugh. 
erik solheim, the head of un environment, also welcomed the british decision.
“the powerful call to scale up global marine protection, made by the united kingdom today, should serve as a guiding light for member states around the world. marine protection should be the rule, not the exception,” he said. 
“particularly for the most vulnerable, high-traffic and resource-rich marine habitats, the time for effective management and action on our oceans and seas is now,” solheim added. 
the current target, agreed by parties to the united nations convention on biological diversity in 2010, is to protect at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas by 2020. that goal was incorporated into the sustainable development goals in 2015, with world leaders also committing to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution by 2025. 
however, to date just over seven per cent of the oceans are formally protected. the conservation group wwf says that the vast majority of existing marine parks and reserves are either poorly managed or not looked after at all.
pugh noted the need to ensure any new target was backed by strong rules governing activities within the mpas.
“while we welcome this landmark decision, we need to focus not only on the number but the nature of the protection. fully protected mpas is what it takes for these oceans to fully recover. without this a protected area is like a frame without a picture,” said pugh, who played a pivotal role in creating the largest mpa in the world in the ross sea off antarctica.
oceans cover three-quarters of the earth’s surface, and occupy 97 per cent the habitable space on the planet, meaning that healthy oceans are critical to all life on earth. they have absorbed 30 per cent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans and over one billion people depend on seafood as their main source of animal protein. the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated at about 5 per cent of global gross domestic product. 
among the threats to our oceans, all of which are exacerbated by climate change, are industrial fishing and overfishing, coastal development, deep sea mining, toxic waste dumping, acidification and a toxic tide of plastic pollution that is killing birds and other wildlife.
callum roberts, professor of marine conservation at the university of york, said mpas would give people and wildlife more time to adapt to the rapid changes already taking place.
“protecting more ocean boosts prospects for fisheries. if you stop fishing an area, the fish quickly become bigger and more abundant, producing many times more offspring. these eggs and young fish spill into fishing grounds and increase catches. this means that by fishing less, in time it is actually possible to catch more fish, at less expense from more prolific stocks.”
britain’s environment secretary michael gove said ocean protection was a global challenge that required global action.


breaking news: today the uk has decided to forge ahead with our call to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. it’s an historic moment. https://t.co/ofvd3j6gzi 1/8 pic.twitter.com/fl9uuftwrk

“the uk has already safeguarded vast swathes of precious marine habitats, but we must go further. only by working together can we protect our shared home and ensure our marine life continues to be a source of awe and wonder for future generations,” he said on monday.
britain will also push for the 30 per cent target to be adopted at a meeting of the parties to the convention on biological diversity in egypt in november. delegates there are expected to agree on the shape of negotiations to draw up a new global deal for nature at the convention on biological diversity in beijing, china in 2020.
in june, britain announced it planned to create 41 marine conservation zones to safeguard almost 12,000 square kilometres in a major expansion of its so-called ‘blue belt’ of protection. no new damaging activities -- including dredging or significant coastal or offshore development -- would be allowed in these newly protected areas, the government said, while existing harmful activities would be minimised or stopped.
as well as underpinning the health and vitality of marine habitats, the government said the measure would protect rare or threatened marine habitats and species, such as the short snouted seahorse, stalked jellyfish and peacock’s tail seaweed.
mpas already cover around 200,000 square miles of british coastal waters, while the government has pledged to safeguard over four million square kilometres across its overseas territories by 2020. it also plans to publish an international ocean strategy before the end of the year.
britain has signed up to un environment’s clean seas campaign to tackle the excessive use of single-use plastics and turn the toxic tide of plastic pollution engulfing our oceans. in january this year a government ban on plastic microbeads officially went into effect. 
conservationists have long demanded more ambitious action to protect oceans, and more broadly biodiversity. in september two leading scientists joined pugh’s call for at least 30 per cent of the earth’s land and waters be protected by 2030, with this rising to 50 per cent in 2050. if this target was not met, they warned of the possibility of a “major extinction crisis”.
“only 3.6 per cent of the oceans and 14.7 per cent of land are formally protected. many of these protected areas are ‘paper parks’, meaning they are not effectively managed, and one-third of the terrestrial protected lands are under intense human pressure,”national geographic society chief scientist dr. jonathan baillie and dr. ya-ping zhang, vice president of the chinese academy of sciences, wrote in an editorial published in the journal science.
a major challenge to achieving the ambitious 30 per cent target is deciding how to manage activities in the so-called high seas -- parts of the ocean that are outside state or national jurisdictions and that make up over 60 per cent of our oceans. these largely unprotected areas are particularly vulnerable to deep sea mining, over-fishing and prospecting for marine genetic resources.
this month, government representatives from 71 countries gathered in new york at the start of a two-year negotiating process that campaigners hope will result in an international legally binding agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in the high seas. 
“it is imperative that we act now to save our ocean from unsustainable activities and protect its unique ecosystems which we still know so little about,” said british foreign office minister sir alan duncan ahead of the un general assembly.
“this 30 per cent global target to improve ocean management and protection is both ambitious and achievable and we encourage our international partners to take action now.”

World commits to pollution-free planet at environment summit","https://papersmart.unon.org/resolution/index, https://papersmart.unon.org/resolution/index, https://papersmart.unon.org/resolution/uploads/25_19october.pdf","almost 2.5 million pledges from governments, civil society, businesses, and individuals were logged
if all commitments are met, 1.49 billion people will breathe clean air, one-third of the world’s coastlines will be clean, and usd 18.6 billion of investment will come online
ministerial declaration outlines action areas as assembly passes 13 resolutions
nairobi, 6 december 2017 – the world today committed to a pollution-free planet at the close of the un environment assembly in nairobi, with resolutions and pledges promising to improve the lives of billions across the globe by cleaning up our air, land and water.
if every promise made in and around the summit is met, 1.49 billion more people will breathe clean air, 480,000 km (or around 30 per cent) of the world’s coastlines will be clean, and usd 18.6 billion for research and development and innovative programmes to combat pollution will come online.
“the science we have seen at this assembly shows we have been so bad at looking after our planet that we have very little room to make more mistakes,” said dr. edgar gutiérrez, minister of environment and energy of costa rica and the president of the 2017 un environment assembly. “with the promises made here, we are sending a powerful message that we will listen to the science, change the way we consume and produce, and tackle pollution in all its forms across the globe.”
over 4,000 heads of state, ministers, business leaders, un officials, civil society representatives, activists and celebrities gathered at the summit in nairobi, which ran for three days. 
for the first time at a un environment assembly, environment ministers issued a declaration. this declaration said nations would honour efforts to prevent, mitigate and manage the pollution of air, land and soil, freshwater, and oceans – which harms our health, societies, ecosystems, economies, and security.
the declaration committed to increasing research and development, targeting pollution through tailored actions, moving societies towards sustainable lifestyles based on a circular economy, promoting fiscal incentives to move markets and promote positive change, strengthening and enforcing laws on pollution, and much more.
the assembly also passed 13 non-binding resolutions and three decisions. among them were moves to address marine litter and microplastics, prevent and reduce air pollution, cut out lead poisoning from paint and batteries, protect water-based ecosystems from pollution, deal with soil pollution, and manage pollution in areas hit by conflict and terrorism.
“today we have put the fight against pollution high on the global political agenda,” said erik solheim, head of un environment. “we have a long struggle ahead of us, but the summit showed there is a real appetite for significant positive change.
“it isn’t just about the un and governments, though. the massive support we have seen from civil society, businesses and individuals – with millions of pledges to end pollution – show that this is a global challenge with a global desire to win this battle together.”
a large part of the impact from the assembly comes from global support. un environment’s #beatpollution campaign hit almost 2.5 million pledges during the event, with 88,000 personal commitments to act.
chile, oman, south africa and sri lanka all joined the #cleanseas campaign during the nairobi summit, with sri lanka promising to implement a ban on single-use plastic products from 1 january 2018, step up the separation and recycling of waste, and set the goal of freeing its ocean and coasts of pollution by 2030. there are now 39 countries in the campaign.
colombia, singapore, bulgaria, hungary and mongolia joined 100 cities who were already in the #breathelife campaign, which aims to tackle air pollution. every signatory has committed to reduce air pollution to safe levels by 2030, with singapore promising to tighten fuel and emissions standards for vehicles, and emissions standards for industry.
the global momentum comes not a moment too soon, as the un environment report, the executive director’s report: towards a pollution-free planet, lays out.
overall, environmental degradation causes nearly one in four of all deaths worldwide, or 12.6 million people a year, and the widespread destruction of key ecosystems. air pollution is the single biggest environmental killer, claiming 6.5 million lives each year. 
exposure to lead in paint causes brain damage to 600,000 children annually. our seas already contain 500 “dead zones” with too little oxygen to support marine life. over 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is released into the environment without treatment, poisoning the fields where we grow our food and the lakes and rivers that provide drinking water to 300 million people. 
there is also a huge economic cost. a recent report by the lancet commission on pollution and health says that welfare losses due to pollution are estimated at over usd 4.6 trillion each year, equivalent to 6.2 per cent of global economic output.
“we had two missions at this assembly,” said ibrahim thiaw, un environment’s deputy head. “one [agreeing on action] is accomplished. the second we must start tomorrow.”

Faith-based organizations can help drive sustainable development, says new report","https://parliamentofreligions.org/, https://uri.org/, https://www.bhumiglobal.org/, https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/33848, https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesquite, https://faithfornature.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brochure-Faith-for-Earth-24-August-2020.pdf, https://ipbes.net/news/global-assessment-summary-policymakers-final-version-now-available","did you know that faith-based organizations control 8 per cent of the earth’s habitable land, 5 per cent of commercial forests and 10 per cent of financial institutions?
well, they do, which gives them a potentially outsized role in the battle to combat poverty, reverse environmental degradation and limit climate change, say experts.
“the potential aggregate impact of faith-based organizations on sustainable development is immense,” says iyad abumoghli, director of the united nations environment programme (unep) faith for earth initiative.
to highlight this impact, unep in collaboration with the parliament of world’s religions, united religions initiative and bhumi global, recently published a report titled faith action on the un sustainable development goals: progress and outlook.
the report cites numerous examples of how faith-based organizations are helping to safeguard the environment and achieve the sustainable development goals. here are five of them.

sixteen congregations of dominican sisters across the united states have provided $46 million in seed capital for an investment fund that focuses on providing access to clean energy in india and sub-saharan africa. the project highlights the power and wealth of religions and their contribution to financing sustainable development, the report says.
huarango, a species of mesquite tree, is well adapted to surviving in the arid climate of southeastern peru. utilized extensively by pre-columbian cultures, huarango forests have largely been cut down, but are still important for traditional agriculture on the peruvian coast. huarango forests provide farmers and animals with necessary shade, and the leaves feed livestock. a rocha peru, a christian faith organization, has planted 26,000 huarango and other native trees over three years, in conjunction with landowners who manage the new forests. the organization is now extending the project to other regions in peru.
vardayini mata temple in maharashtra, india, sits next to one of several sanctuaries for the endangered mahseer fish. these sanctuaries have conserved the fish as well as stretches of river that remain undammed. (the primary reason for the collapse of the mahseer fishery is dam construction.) though they have received limited support from the conservation community, for hindu devotees these fish are sacred.
photo by ecosikhsikh groups around the world have united to fight climate change by committing to plant 1 million trees in 1,820 different locations globally by november. the project honors the 550th birthday of guru nanak, the founder of sikhism. ecosikh, which strives to connect sikh values with solutions to environmental issues, spearheaded the project. their goal is to increase reforestation, decrease air pollution and encourage people to reconnect with nature. sikhs in punjab, india have already planted tens of thousands of trees.
in 2017, shiloh temple in minneapolis in the united states of america installed a community solar garden on its rooftop. the 630-panel array provides energy to the temple, a neighboring mosque and 29 residences. community solar is starting to become popular with faith-based organizations as a way of bringing renewable energy to low-income communities. in this case, the report says, it’s also helping to build interfaith solidarity and understanding.
the new report will be presented at the faith action for nature conference in iceland. the event, which will be online and run from 5-8 october, aims to mobilize religious denominations in support of the faith for earth coalition.
nature is in crisis, threatened by biodiversity and habitat loss, global heating and toxic pollution. failure to act is failing humanity. addressing the current coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and protecting ourselves against future global threats requires sound management of hazardous medical and chemical waste; strong and global stewardship of nature and biodiversity; and a clear commitment to “building back better”, creating green jobs and facilitating the transition to carbon-neutral economies. humanity depends on action now for a resilient and sustainable future.

home to thousands of species of birds, mammals and freshwater fish, herds of elephant, buffalo, zebra and a variety of other wildlife that roam between tsavo east national park and the north-eastern rangelands, the delta has also long been home to generations of herders and farmers who depend on its rich soils to nourish their crops and livestock. 
it should be an idyllic existence. but population growth and climate change are putting pressure on the delta’s 120,000 residents, sparking inter-ethnic conflict and fierce competition within and between communities for access to an ecosystem already stretched beyond its limits. 
communities bear the cost of degradation
caught between deforestation, increasing drought and nomadic herders desperate to feed their cattle, villages like dide daride are bearing the brunt of the delta’s advancing degradation. 
“when i was younger, we had a full month’s rain and the pastoralists moved away. now it lasts a week and everyone leaves their cattle here,” says 28-year-old elema. “the villagers collect dry wood, but the loggers take living trees. and where there are no trees, the sudden rain sweeps everything away.”
women are particularly impacted: “it’s worse for us. we walk eight kilometres to fetch water for the cows or sell milk, with no guarantee of customers,” says mariam, elema’s elderly mother. 
dide daride elder omar lost 45 cattle over the last dry season due to a lack of pasture. “before, the delta was full of water, and there was enough pasture. but now the delta is beginning to dry,” he says. “sometimes there is no grass on the ground, the area is completely dry.” 
“we don’t have any bank, all we have is these cattle—so if we lose them, we have nothing.”
it’s a familiar story here and with no coherent planning to manage land use there were regular conflicts, reaching a low point in 2012 when 286 people died in clashes between farmers and pastoralists, according to omar. 
climate change is putting increasing pressure on the tana delta’s residents and their surrounding ecosystems, with farmers and herders clashing as they vie for access to land and pasture. photo by unep / lisa murray







“there have been clashes all over. somehow, we have slowly drifted from environmental crisis to a disaster.”

shared decisions defuse tensions
but by bringing communities and commercial interests together to decide on sustainable land use, the restoration initiative, a us$250-million global environment facility-backed global programme implemented in kenya by the un environment programme, is working to defuse local tensions and rebalance the delta’s ecosystem. 
building on the tana delta sustainable land use plan created by villagers and local authorities with nature kenya, the project is developing value chains and motivating private sector investment to secure local livelihoods, while advising on policies and strategies to sustainably manage the delta. 
already, community participation in land-use decisions is having an impact, with nature kenya having helped more than 100 villages to develop land-use plans and realize better management of natural resources, advocate for land restoration and conservation, and influence local government policy on land use. 
“we have agreed who will use which area of land and how to better manage it,” says omar. “now we have the knowledge to create awareness and bring people together. now we can stay in peace.”
women like mariam are amongst the worst impacted by climate change in the delta, with drying conditions forcing them to travel long distances to find water for their livestock or sell the milk they rely on to make a living. photo by unep / lisa murraythe restoration initiative unites 10 asian and african countries – cameroon, pakistan, myanmar, tanzania, central african republic, china, sao tome & principe, guinea bissau, drc, and kenya, with three gef agencies –  fao,  iucn and unep – to overcome existing barriers to restoration and restore degraded landscapes at scale. under the initiative, unep and nature kenya are supporting tana delta communities to take a leading role in the sustainable management of their environment and natural resources. by 2023, the project aims to see over 130,000 ha under sustainable livestock, fish and crop management, with an additional 10,000 ha under restoration, and 95,000 ha reserved for indigenous community conservation areas.
 
the restoration initiative is just one of more than 80 projects the un environment programme has implemented with the backing of the global environment facility in support of the un convention to combat degradation and desertification and other efforts to bring a halt to the threat of land degradation globally. focusing on the theme “investing in land, unlocking opportunities”, the 14th conference of the parties to the un convention to combat degradation and desertification is taking place in delhi, india from 2 to 14 september 2019.

image viawith three quarters of the world’s coral reefs already at risk – due to threats ranging from invasive species to ocean acidification to sunscreen pollution – the time for action is now. the international coral reef initiative has dubbed 2018 the international year of the reef. things have already kicked off in fiji, with an announcement from the government of a major new protected site. un environment has also just begun a detailed analysis of the status of coral reefs in the pacific. watch out for more news and action on reefs as the year progresses. 
 
2. plastic pollution
image viabuilding on the momentum of the 2017 un environment assembly, a major focus of 2018 will be minimizing plastic pollution – by phasing out single-use shopping bags, banning microbeads in cosmetics, and promoting the use of sustainable alternatives. expect to see more news and major announcements on this front, including from major multinational companies, in 2018. 
 
3. greening the world of sport
image viawith the winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea next month, the world cup in russia in june and july, and the youth olympics in buenos aires in october, 2018 will be a flagship year in the world of sport. keep an eye out for announcements of new sustainability commitments from major sports organizations. with billions of sports fans around the world, the potential impact here is enormous. 
 
4. environment and migration
image viain december, the international community will gather in morocco to try to strike a new global deal for migrants and refugees. climate change and environmental degradation have already been officially recognized as drivers of migration - a fact that's driven home by the climate-related disasters that continue to grab headlines. 
 
5. cities and climate change
image viaa major theme 2018 will be how the world’s cities can take the lead on both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing innovative ways to adapt to the changing climate. landmark moments on this front will be the resilient cities conference in bonn, germany in april, and the global climate action summit, to be hosted by san francisco in september. 
 
6. big cats

from bringing flowers and chocolates to buying gifts for children, family, friends and co-workers, why not think about the environment too when you consider gifts this year?
there are lots of gift ideas that don’t come at a cost to the earth. from making things yourself to selecting gifts that cut down on waste or electricity use, think creatively about how to use fewer natural resources.
for example, beatriz martins carneiro, un environment programme (unep) management officer in ecolabelling and consumer information, said:
“business strategies such as second-hand market, upcycling and repair are key to help closing the loop for circularity, allowing products and materials to be kept in the market for as long as possible. instead of buying new, why not look for unique, exclusive pieces in second-hand markets or upcycling shops?”
pioneered by young entrepreneurs, winners and finalists in the annual young champions of the earth prize are also working on innovation ideas—from eco-friendly packaging to skin care products—to make your gift special and earth-friendly.
here are three ways to help you buy green this holiday season.
nature’s gifts 
from plant-based food to organic face creams and deodorants, one idea is to be inspired by nature for gifts.
twenty-nine-year-old lisa curtis decided to start making nutritious dietary supplements from moringa oleifera, a nutrient-dense tree. she works with moringa farmers in ghana, haiti and nicaragua to make her tasty goodies available to a global audience.
meanwhile, twenty-six-year-old celine jennison takes inspiration from nature for nutrient-dense skin care collection. from black cedar soap to evening oils and deodorants, her handcrafted goods use tree crops and organic perennial plants.
her products nurture regenerative agriculture and ocean conservation in a healthy and affordable way, through zero-waste products which are regenerative by design.    
upcycle it 
the fashion industry is responsible for 8 to 10 per cent of global carbon emissions—more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.
yet the state of fashion 2019 report by mckinsey & company notes that 9 in 10 generation z consumers—those born between 1994 and 2014—believe companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues.
young people are leading the way in recycling and upcycling clothes. young champion for the earth omar itani in lebanon is a case in point. his company fabricaid takes the concept of upcycling a to the next level by helping vulnerable communities to afford quality second-hand clothing.

inspirational eco-packaging 
when 19-year-old alhaji siraji bah from sierra leone lost everything in a devastating mud slide, he could have given up. instead, he used this experience to learn about drivers of this type of disaster. his research yielded that deforestation and massive amounts of waste were leading to environmental degradation.
in the middle east and africa, almost 1,000 tonnes of waste is produced every day, around 50 per cent of which is predominantly plastic and biomass waste, says bah. “we asked ourselves how to help reduce this waste, while also creating a viable businesses opportunity.
bah’s company tackles the waste crisis in sierra leone by making biodegradable paper bags from banana leaves to reduce plastic pollution. they have made more than 250,000 bags.
in india, 27-year-old nitish singh’s gecko-inspired reusable paper can be used more than 100 times. it can be written on with conventional pens, ball-point, sketch pen and marker pen, and removed by wiping the paper with a wet cloth.
most wrapping paper is only used once. imagine the inputs for single-use paper: manufacturing requires huge quantities of water: around 5 litres of fresh water for making only 1 a4 sheet, according to singh. by 2020, global production of a4 sheets is expected to exceed 25 trillion per year, demanding 60 million hectares of forest, equivalent to the area of france, to be destroyed, notes singh.
garrette clark, unep’s sustainable lifestyles officer, said: “these are only some of the ways your holidays can make a difference! try rethinking gifts entirely—no wrapping needed!
“if you do buy gifts, be inspired by nature or buy products and services that integrate sustainability concerns. try to use reusable, decorated bags, magazines, newspaper, outdated maps or fabrics for wrapping for example,” she said.

last month, as wildfires continued to rage across the american west, pascal peduzzi, a climate scientist with the united nations environment programme (unep) in geneva, followed the situation with air quality in mammoth lakes, a town high in california’s sierra nevada mountains.
on wednesday 23 september on the town’s ranch road the pm2.5 measurement – the tally of airborne particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres – reached 501mg per cubic metre (µg/m3) of air. that is over 50 times the threshold that the world health organisation (who) considers safe for the average pm2.5 reading over one year. it is more than 20 times the level considered safe for a 24-hour period.
“i’ve never seen it that high,” peduzzi stated.
the scientist was not in california, nor in the us. he was in switzerland, over 9,000km away. nonetheless, he, and anyone with an internet connection, can now follow in detail pm2.5 levels in the west coast fire zone, and across the planet, via unep’s world environment situation room (wesr). this online portal offers a near-real-time monitor of global air quality.

“the intention of this platform was to connect to people,” said sean khan, an expert on air pollution with unep in nairobi. “it was designed to inspire and stimulate action, whether that’s communities trying to convince policymakers to do things or vice versa.”
in august, following record-breaking high temperatures, lightning strikes from severe thunderstorms ignited fires in california, oregon and washington. by the end of september, these blazes had consumed over 2 million hectares of land across the three states. they had destroyed over 7,000 structures and left at least 40 people dead.

governments, smart data and wildfires: where are we at?












“we now currently have five active fires that are five of the most destructive fires in the history of the state,” gavin newsom, the governor of california, said on 11 september, standing in smoky air among scorched trees.
the fires threw fine particulate matter into the atmosphere. alongside producing the extraordinary orange skies seen in television reports, studies have linked elevated pm2.5 levels with a range of health problems. these include asthma, respiratory inflammation, jeopardised lung function and even cancer.
one study conducted for seven years (from 2000 to 2007) in the us indicated that average life span extends by 0.35 years for every 10 µg/m3 decrease in pm2.5. another, which tracked 1.2 million american adults for 26 years from 1982 to 2008, found that the mortality of lung cancer increased by 15–27% when pm2.5 air concentrations increased by 10 µg/m3. 
“if you are someone with pulmonary complications, then you are vulnerable, you’ll be at risk,” khan said. the wesr air portal includes a mobile app which offers weekly and daily hyperlocal forecasts in addition to user customised alerts for pm2.5.




 
this year’s us wildfires are not an isolated meteorological phenomenon but reflect a changing climate.






in the last 20 years, california experienced more years of drought – as classified on the us drought monitor’s (usdm) five-point scale – than it did without drought. the usdm gradings range from d0 – an area experiencing short-term dryness - up to d4, an area experiencing “exceptional and widespread crop and pasture losses, fire risk, and water shortages that result in water emergencies.”
there were droughts between 2001 and 2005, 2007 and 2010, and from 2012 to 2017. these became more intense over time. the most severe period, between january 2014 and january 2017, led to a severe water deficit in both the soil and underground aquifers.
“it’s definitely a shift in climate, it’s no longer a 10%, extreme event,” pascal peduzzi said. the changing climate also creates loop effects; warmer temperatures generate more evaporation, drying out soils and vegetation, in turn leaving them more susceptible to fire. the fires themselves, meanwhile, add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, alongside particulates, further contributing to climate change.  
“if you have dry soils, and basically no precipitation, put a bit more wind on that and someone lighting a barbecue, and that’s it,” peduzzi added. “it’s a recipe for disaster.”  
the wesr platform is a collaboration between the un and swiss firm iqair, which operates its own air quality monitoring platform.
at maximum zoom-out, it shows a map of the planet, with arrows depicting wind patterns and air quality in particular areas represented by a shading system; green is good, yellow moderate, orange is unhealthy for sensitive groups.
red represents unhealthy conditions, while two shades of purple show very unhealthy and hazardous levels. last friday, 5,185,211,024 people, or 66.4% of the world’s population, were exposed to polluted air worse than who recommended limits. that figure updates every four hours.
zoom in and you come to circles containing numbers, at first average pm2.5 readings across a region and then down to individual sensors like that on ranch road in mammoth lakes. flame icons show burning fires. by friday the pm2.5 tally on ranch road had fallen to 32.8 µg/m3
however, a mobile monitoring station in pollock pines, further north in the sierra nevada, was registering 706.4 µg/m3. the us wildfire season is not over yet.

Business unusual: How “fish carbon” stabilizes our climate","https://eye-on-earth.net/, https://news.gefblueforests.org/international-endorsement-of-whale-carbon, https://news.gefblueforests.org/international-endorsement-of-whale-carbon","a new concept, “fish carbon”, recognizes the potential of marine life to address the climate change challenge and prevent global biodiversity loss. 
oceans, and all marine life that lives under and above the water, play a central role in stabilizing the earth’s climate. they provide a vital source of food to a vast number of land and water species and regulate the amount of co2 that stays in the atmosphere by absorbing 30 per cent of global emissions.
“fish carbon” is a term used to describe the carbon interactions of all marine vertebrates that contribute to the oceans’ carbon sequestration: turtles, sea birds, mammals such as whales and dolphins, and fish such as sharks, tuna and sardines. these interactions or mechanisms are the natural life processes of marine life that enable capture of atmospheric carbon, allow carbon storage in benign form deep in the ocean, and provide a potential buffer against ocean acidification.




learn about the fish carbon mechanisms in this 4 and a half-minute video
“the fish carbon concept is not without precedence in conservation policy,” says steven lutz, blue carbon programme leader for un environment/grid-arendal. “just last month in support of sustainable whale management, 41 nations of the international whaling commission endorsed two resolutions recognizing the value of whales in carbon storage and their potential role in climate change mitigation.”
recent science has revealed that the natural, biological processes of whales can help trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce climate change. these processes are commonly referred to as “whale carbon” and they can take different forms.
whales eat a lot and they excrete enormous quantities of nutrients that help phytoplankton grow. when whales swim from ocean depths to the surface, they also increase nutrient availability for phytoplankton. like plants on land, phytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide. more phytoplankton means more carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere.
 
launch of the fish carbon video and oceanic blue carbon story map at the eye on earth summit in dubai, uae. credit: steven lutz, grid-arendalwhales are also big and long-lived. this means they store a lot of carbon in their bodies, and for long periods of time. when they die and sink to the ocean floor, they bring all of that trapped carbon with them where it can remain buried for millennia.
“whales feed deep in the ocean and return to the surface to breath, digest, and, well… poo,” said heidi pearson, a marine biology professor at the university of alaska southeast and fulbright scholar at un environment/grid-arendal.
“the buoyant fecal plumes produced by whales are rich in the nutrients that phytoplankton need to grow and thus, importantly, absorb carbon dioxide in surface waters, allowing for more carbon to be naturally drawn into the oceans from the atmosphere.”

much work remains to measure the value of whale carbon and harnessing it for climate change action. however, the majority of countries that have endorsed the international whaling commission resolutions clearly indicate that there is great potential interest in the role that whales and other marine life can play in combating climate change.
“recognizing the role marine life may play in mitigating climate change may help small island developing states, especially those who are large ocean nations, include ocean actions in their nationally determined contributions under the paris agreement,” says ronald jumeau, permanent representative to the united nations and ambassador for climate change for the republic of seychelles.
“seychelles believes that the sustainable management of life in our ocean is critically important in our fight against climate change. given the dire warnings from the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) report, can we afford not to explore this option.”
one of the international whaling commission resolutions encourages member states “to integrate the value of cetaceans’ ecological roles into local, regional, and global organizations on biodiversity and environment, including climate change.”
link to blue forests
coastal and marine ecosystems, including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and saltwater marshes, support livelihoods and wellbeing across the globe. these “blue forests” are vital for coastal and island communities through the many services they provide, such as shoreline protection, providing essential habitat for fisheries and supporting marine biodiversity. they are also significant for our global climate by storing and sequestering atmospheric carbon, giving them additional value and significance in the global climate challenge.
fish carbon mechanisms may one day be used to support sustainable fisheries management. credit: catlin seaview surveythe global environment facility (gef) international waters focal area is enabling the blue forests project to provide the first global-scale assessment of the values associated with coastal carbon and ecosystem services, to achieve improved ecosystem management through recognition of these values. the project also improves knowledge for informed decision-making, raises awareness and fosters cooperation among all stakeholders. upon completion, the project will provide experience and tools for greater global application.
the fish carbon concept has been recently profiled through an innovative fish carbon video and oceanic blue carbon story map, launched at the eye on earth summit, held in dubai over 22-24 september. “through partner co-finance, from blue climate solutions, a project of the ocean foundation, and grid-arendal, the blue forests project is helping to explore the value of carbon beyond the coasts,” says lutz.
“this work contributes to the outcomes of the blue forests project and our blue forests joint strategy with un environment. given that over 50 countries already recognize coastal ecosystems in nature-based climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in their nationally determined contributions, this work reveals the exiting potential to include the sustainable management of fisheries and charismatic megafauna in such actions,” he says.
marine ecosystems expert gabriel grimsditch adds: “the work on fish carbon enhances our knowledge of carbon fluxes in the ocean, and the role that megafauna can play in the global climate. the video introduces the concept and the story map illustrates the science behind fish carbon mechanisms.”
grid-arendal is a norwegian foundation committed to supporting environmentally sustainable development by working with un environment and other partners, and through a mission of creating environmental knowledge that encourages positive change.

Food loss and waste must be reduced for greater food security and environmental sustainability","https://champions123.org/about-champions-123, ///C:/Users/oconnorc/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/JBO2WX15/Champions%2012.3%20(2020)%20SDG%2012.3%20Global%20Progress%20Report%20https:/champions123.org/sites/default/files/2020-09/champions-12-3-2020-progress-report.pdf, https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/centre-excellence-rwanda-aims-support-african-farmers-and-rural, https://www.feedthefuture.gov/article/small-gadget-big-impact-young-entrepreneur-fights-food-loss-with-innovation/, https://www.feedthefuture.gov/article/small-gadget-big-impact-young-entrepreneur-fights-food-loss-with-innovation/","rome/nairobi/new york , 29 september 2020 – at the global event marking today the first international day of awareness of food loss and waste, the un food and agriculture organization (fao), the un environment programme (unep) and their partners urged everyone to do more to reduce food loss and waste or risk an even greater drop in food security and natural resources.
some 690 million people today are hungry and three billion cannot afford a healthy diet. hunger has been on the rise for the past five years, and the covid-19 pandemic is threatening the food and nutrition security of up to an additional 132 million of people. on top of that, we are faced with an ecosystem decline and the consequences of climate change.
yet, food continues to be lost and wasted. this year we have witnessed an increase in food loss and waste as a result of movement and transport restrictions due to the pandemic.
covid-19 aside, however, each year about 14 percent of the world’s food is lost before even reaching the market. food loss is valued at $400 billion annually – about the gdp of austria. on top of this comes food waste, for which new estimates are coming out early 2021. when it comes to environmental impact, food loss and waste generate eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
food loss occurs from farm up to and excluding retail, whilst food waste occurs at retail, food service and household level. causes range from poor handling, inadequate transport or storage, lack of cold chain capacity, extreme weather conditions to cosmetic standards, and a lack of planning and cooking skills among consumers.
simply put, reducing food lost or wasted means more food for all, less greenhouse gas emissions, less pressure on environment, and increased productivity and economic growth.  
innovation, technologies and behavioral change – key to reducing food loss and waste 
“food loss and waste is a big challenge of our time,” said fao director-general qu dongyu, urging for stronger partnerships, more public and private investments in training for smallholder farmers, technology and innovation” to step up the fight against food loss and waste as “our planet is a small boat in the universe.”
“innovative postharvest treatment, digital agriculture and food systems and re-modelling market channels offer huge potential to tackle the challenges of food loss and waste. we have just built a partnership with ibm, microsoft and the vatican to empower artificial intelligence in all these areas,” added qu.
inger andersen, executive director of unep, encouraged governments to make food loss and waste part of national climate strategies.
“only 11 countries have so far included food loss in their nationally determined contributions. none of them included food waste. by including food loss and waste and sustainable diets in revised climate plans, policymakers can improve their mitigation and adaptation from food systems by as much as 25 percent,” said andersen.
calling food loss and waste “an ethical outrage” given that so many people go hungry, antónio guterres, united nations secretary-general, in a message sent in support of the day, urged everyone to play their part in tackling this issue – from countries setting a reduction target and measuring their food loss and waste and policy action in this area being included in climate plans under the paris agreement to businesses taking a similar approach and individuals shopping carefully, storing food correctly, and using leftovers.
the need for everyone to come together and step up efforts to reduce food loss and waste, including through innovation, technologies and education, to shift behavioural norms away from waste, to measure and track progress, as well as work towards increasing the availability of food and reducing the environmental footprint of agricultural production – topics to be explored in depth at the 2021 food system summit – were echoed by speakers and panel discussion participants from the un, european commission, private and public sectors, agriculture ministries of developing and developed countries, farmers’, markets’ and consumers’ organisations and associations, academia and chefs.
solutions to reduce food loss and waste
solutions to stem food loss and waste include: good data to know where in the value chain the major hot spots of food loss and waste are; applying innovation - for example, e-commerce platforms for marketing or retractable mobile food processing systems; government incentives to bolster private sector food loss and waste action and collaboration across supply chains; investments in training, technology and innovation, including for small-scale producers; better food packaging and relaxing on regulations and standards on aesthetic requirements for fruit and vegetables; behaviours that value and make the most of food at home; redistributing safe surplus food to those in need through food banks; facilitating farmer’s access to consumers and shorter value chains through farmers markets and rural urban linkages; and investing more to strengthen infrastructure and logistics, including sustainable cold chains and cooling technologies.
in many countries a large proportion of produce is lost during transportation. to address this, fao has introduced improved, sustainable bulk packaging (in the form of stackable and nestable plastic crates), along with good post-harvest management practice, to transport fresh produce in a number of southern and south-eastern asian countries. the use of crates during transport has reduced losses of vegetables and fruits by up to 87 percent. where crates replaced single-use plastic bags, this has also brought environmental benefits. (source sofa 2019, p. 36)
unep, together with high-level coalition champions 12.3, has developed a target-measure-act approach to food loss and waste reduction. the united kingdom, a pioneer of this approach, has achieved a 27 percent reduction in post-farm gate food loss and waste per capita by 2018 relative to its 2007 baseline, making it the first country in the world to have advanced more than halfway towards the achievement of sdg 12.3. good data has helped the uk to make the case for action, together with an effective public-private partnership to facilitate cross supply chain collaboration, leveraging innovation in food promotion, labeling, and design, and a long-standing public behaviour change campaign, with re-doubled efforts and impacts on household food behaviours during the global pandemic. several companies including tesco (central europe), campbell, and arla foods have achieved food loss and waste reductions of more than 25 percent—suggesting that achieving the target is possible for companies, too.
a new african centre of excellence for sustainable cooling and cold chain based in rwanda is helping get farmers’ produce to market quickly and efficiently – reducing food waste, boosting profits and creating jobs.
elsewhere, young entrepreneurs like isaac sesi – who spoke at the event – also fight food loss with innovation. sesi and the feed the future innovation lab for the reduction of post-harvest loss at kansas state university are providing farmers in ghana – isaac’s home country – with an affordable moisture meter called grainmate, which measures the moisture content of maize and other grains, helping farmers ensure the grains are sufficiently dried and tackle the main cause of post-harvest loss in grain - insufficient drying before storage, which creates conditions for fungal growth, contamination and insect infestation.

food loss and waste – facts and figures
in terms of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, the food that is lost is associated with around 1.5 gigatonnes of co2 equivalent every year.
unep will publish new country level food waste estimates at retail, food service and household level in its food waste index report, early in 2021, and a common methodology for food waste measurement at national level on world food day, october 16th 2020.
studies commissioned by fao before the pandemic estimate that on-farm losses in sub-saharan africa for fruits and vegetables are up to 50 percent, the highest in the world. for cereals and pulses, the on-farm losses are up to 18 percent, equal highest in the world with parts of asia.
reducing food loss early in the supply chain – on the farm - in countries with high levels of food insecurity is likely to yield the strongest positive result for greater food security.
many countries deal with the growing demand for food by increasing agricultural production without reducing food loss and waste, and, thereby, exacerbating pressure on environment and increasingly scarce natural resources.
 
notes to editors
about the international day of awareness of food loss and waste
the marking of the day - under the slogan stop food loss and waste. for the people. for the planet - took place during the 75th session of the un general assembly. a video of the event can be found here.
the event was hosted by fao and unep – the agencies leading global efforts on food loss and waste reduction together with andorra, argentina and san marino who were instrumental in establishing the international day through a un general assembly resolution adopted unanimously last year.
about the un environment programme (unep)
unep is the leading global voice on the environment. it provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations.

it is a sobering picture, but working together we can change this narrative. and we can take inspiration from individuals across the globe who are doing all they can to stem the toxic tide and advocate for long-term changes that will permanently redefine our relationship with plastics.
to celebrate world oceans day, we’re profiling a few remarkable people who are fighting the good fight for our seas.
1. tiza mafira: waging war on plastic bags in indonesia
(courtesy of tiza mafira)tiza mafira, a lawyer and director of the indonesia plastic bag diet movement, has long campaigned to ban single-use plastic bags in her country. her organization launched a petition in 2015 asking retailers to no longer give out plastic bags for free. the following year, a nationwide trial of a plastic bag charge was introduced. after six months, there had been a 55 per cent reduction in the use of plastic bags. several provinces began to prepare their own regulations and two cities in indonesia have banned plastic bags in modern retail stores.
although the plastic problem might seem overwhelming, mafira draws hope from the fact that the solution is, ultimately, simple.
“plastic is such a tangible thing. it is visible, you use it every day, you see it, and you can witness the sheer volume of its destruction to the environment. this is not something you can deny … as such the pathways to stopping the destruction are much clearer - not easier, but clearer. you either ban it where it is unnecessary or change it to compostable material. this simplicity gives me hope and, at the very least, it gives me a clear vision of what to fight for.”
mafira also campaigns for the creation of zero-waste cities, where every single piece of trash biodegrades in nature or circles back to become a raw material for production.
she is cautiously optimistic that more progress can be made to reduce the excessive use of plastic in indonesia, the second-largest contributor to marine plastic pollution after china.
“i’m optimistic because progress has already been made and cautious because the more imminent change appears to be, the more interest groups attempt to strike it down,” she says.
most plastic waste comes from poorer countries, many in asia, but mafira says it does not help when developed countries promote technological solutions as the sole answer.
“technology is expensive, contextual and does not operate independently of the waste supply chain. plastic reduction policies should still be a priority, along with fixing the waste supply chain to ensure waste doesn’t leak out to waterways,” she says, adding that developed countries must set an example and require their multinationals to do the same wherever they operate.  
mafira’s own role models include all those people who commit to a zero-waste lifestyle.
“i cannot name just one person because there are several and the number is increasing now. they give me inspiration that this is actually doable, even if you just start with yourself.”
 
2. afroz shah: the man behind the world’s biggest beach cleanup 
(un environment)lawyer afroz shah is best known for his work cleaning versova beach in mumbai but his battle against marine plastic pollution goes much deeper.
every week, he and his volunteers clean beaches and mangrove swamps, and visit schools to educate children about what they do. another key element of shah’s five-point action plan is his work among the 50,000-strong population of two beach-side settlements -- what he calls human-ocean conflict zones -- to educate them about the devastating effects of plastic litter and turn them into zero-waste communities.
key to his strategy is his belief in the importance of changing mindsets.
“the problem is not with plastic,” he says. “the problem is our empathy towards plastic or how we handle plastic.”
shah, who was awarded the un’s champions of the earth honour in 2016, believes that plastic bans cannot be effective if people’s mindsets are not changed.
“what we have to ban is what is in our heads and hearts: our empathy towards plastic, our disconnect with nature, our disconnect towards the ocean. there are plenty of laws, policies and regulations, which govern the use and misuse of plastic, but we have to ask, is this law or policy going to change people’s hearts and minds?”
it all began in 2015, when shah moved into an apartment overlooking versova beach. he was stunned by the mounds of plastic littering the shoreline. he felt he had to act so with his neighbour, harbansh mathur, he started picking up the trash. what began as a daunting personal mission turned into the world’s largest beach cleanup, attracting dozens of volunteers every weekend for the past few years and turning the devastated stretch of plastic-strewn sand into a clean beach where vulnerable turtles have hatched for the first time in decades.
over the long months of backbreaking work, shah has been joined by slum-dwellers, bollywood stars, foreign diplomats and politicians. so far, the volunteers have removed around 15 million kilograms from the 2.5-km beach.
shah says marine debris is a complex problem and requires action by citizens and governments as well as plastic manufacturers: “the narrative should not be us versus them. the question is can we all work together? environmental protection is very complex. it’s not about one remedy versus another remedy.”
shah has inspired others to launch their own anti-litter crusades with hundreds of volunteers turning up in april to join shiv sena leader aaditya thackeray and actress dia mirza to clean dadar beach in mumbai.
 
3. hugo tagholm: fighting for cleaner beaches with surfers against sewage
(courtesy of hugo tagholm)tagholm traces his enthusiasm for beach cleaning to the days he spent mudlarking -- searching for buried treasure along river banks -- with his father and brother on the foreshores of the thames. a keen surfer and environmentalist, he joined surfers against sewage in 1991 and has seen the charity evolve from a single-issue pressure group, focusing on water quality, into one of the uk’s most popular marine conservation charities. it now has more than 350,000 regular supporters and each year it can mobilise around 50,000 volunteers, who spend around 150,000 hours cleaning the country’s beaches.
tagholm became ceo in 2008 and set about helping the charity develop its policies on the most pressing environmental threats -- plastic pollution and climate change.
he says we are at a tipping point where society is redefining its relationship with plastic.
“the consensus is there -- we cannot keep using plastic in the way we do today. the evidence is all around us every day on our city streets, in the countryside and on our beaches. i believe that the community movement is growing so rapidly that businesses and governments now have to adapt,” he says, adding that reducing the use of virgin plastic or going plastic-free has to be recognised as a market advantage and a vote winner.
“businesses will go out of business otherwise. governments will lose power. but we are all in this together -- this is a convergence of individuals, business and the state, who need to collaborate to reduce the plastic pollution burden on the planet.”
surfers against sewage campaigned for the uk’s five-pence plastic bag charge, which has been credited with drastically reducing the number of bags found in the seas around britain. it is also pushing for a uk-wide deposit return scheme on drinks containers, which is being considered by the government.
the charity has now launched a new campaign: plastic free communities. this international initiative is designed to encourage individuals, businesses and local government to reduce their collective plastic footprint. hundreds of communities are already working towards “plastic free” status, which will mean they have committed to eliminate specific items of avoidable, single-use plastic and are working to decouple their communities from throwaway plastics. ultimately, this initiative could reach over 19 million people.
despite the scale of the plastic problem, tagholm believes the revolution is just beginning.
“the levels of activity on this globally inspire me daily as new avoidable plastic bans are introduced, plastic free communities are launched and businesses innovate new plastic free solutions,” he says. “people want change. the electorate wants change.”
 
4. sasina kaudelka: grassroots activism on the beaches of thailand
(courtesy of sasina kaudelka)in 2015, sasina kaudelka co-founded the ao nang chapter of trash hero, the global movement that works to bring communities together to clean and reduce waste, educate the next generation and create long-term programmes to help people manage their rubbish.
each week, sasina and local volunteers meet to clean up the beaches in ao nang and around the river near krabi town. 
“i love the idea behind trash hero and the approach. krabi is my home. for me, it’s important to bring the community together, not create division. it’s about connecting with like-minded people to try to make a change. it’s important also to show our kids a better way to take care of nature.” 
in 2016, trash hero thailand won the thailand green excellence award for its outstanding contribution to green tourism. for kaudelka, the power of her group lies in people’s personal motivation to be the change they want to see.
“people who join our cleanups want to make a difference, to take action, to make it happen with our own hands … we motivate people by our positivity as we do not blame anyone, there is no finger-pointing. we do it because it makes us feel good in ourselves to be giving back to nature.”
in thailand, the total amount of garbage making its way into the sea was estimated at around 2.8 million tonnes in 2016 and 12 per cent of that was plastic. the government says it has a 20-year strategy to tackle the problem, including by introducing financial incentives to keep plastic out of the sea.
kaudelka is confident that change is coming.
“it’s a big issue that people cannot ignore any more. we have over 50 groups in southeast asia that started spontaneously from local people wanting to change and we see many other similar groups working to pressure government and industry to take action. i feel we are getting close to a tipping point where society will finally say ‘enough!’” she says.
 
5. stiv wilson: harnessing the power of stories to change the plastic narrative
(courtesy of stiv wilson)long-time ocean activist stiv wilson believes that the secret to success lies in collective action.
“many of our community have realised that to change the world, we need to change the systems that pollute it. and that means not asking ‘what can i do’ and much more asking ‘what can we do’. collective action is how we win.”
now working at the story of stuff project, wilson previously spearheaded a us campaign against plastic microbeads and is also pushing for a bill in california that would require clothing that is more than 50 per cent polyester to have a label saying it sheds in an effort to stem the flow of microfibres into waterways and oceans.
the story of stuff project, which began with a 2007 documentary by founder annie leonard looking at consumer culture, now has a global community of around one million members or changemakers. they include parents, community leaders, teachers, students and scientists who are all committed to creating a healthier and more just world.  
wilson has seen the effects of plastic pollution firsthand: previously as deputy director at non-profit 5gyres, he sailed over 35,000 nautical miles to four of the five oceanic garbage patches to document marine plastic pollution.
wilson is now travelling the world again, seeking solutions to plastic pollution from local activists for a film on “the story of plastic”. he is a fervent believer in harnessing local knowledge to find durable solutions to address our excessive consumption of single-use plastic.
“we are amplifying thought leaders who have scalable solutions and the ability to implement them,” he says. “this issue is solvable only if we listen to the right people, the voices that aren’t amplified on the world stage. our film will be a roadmap for creating the world we want … we just need to mobilise resources to different entities and we’ll create the power needed for change.”
for wilson, activism is an intensely personal issue.
“we ultimately fight for the people next to us, the people we care about, all living things and the natural world that soothes our senses. i can’t do anything else .. i just keep doing, keep pushing against the convenience industrial complex because it simply must change.”

Meet James Wakibia, the campaigner behind Kenya's plastic bag ban","https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/05/04/th-e-hashtag-which-laid-the-groundwork-for-blanket-ban-on-plastic-bags_c1554129","james wakibia, 35, didn’t set out to be an environmental activist. but the pollution in his hometown of nakuru, 150 km from the kenyan capital, eventually got so bad that he felt compelled to act.
in 2015, wakibia started a social media campaign, using the twitter hashtag #banplasticske, to call for a ban on plastics, with a focus on bags. the campaign soon won the support of kenya’s cabinet secretary for environment and natural resources, judi wakhungu, and things snowballed from there. 
wakibia has since been credited with starting the movement that led to kenya’s nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags, which took effect in 2017. here, he tells us about his work, his true passion, and the message he wants to send his country’s leaders.
plastic pollution at nakuru sewage treatment plant, next to lake nakuru national park. photo byjames wakibiatell us a bit about yourself. how did you become interested in environmental issues?
i went to a local boys’ primary school just when the forest in elburgon near nakuru was being cut down and land cleared for cultivation by the moi regime, which was in power at the time. that was the epitome of environmental destruction. 
i was driven to environmental activism by anger. from around 2011, i got angry about the poorly managed gioto dump site in nakuru, with so much trash, especially plastic bags, scattered all over the road.
i felt something needed to be done, so in 2013 i delivered a petition to the county government of nakuru to demand the relocation of the dumpsite, but in vain: the county government said it had no plans to close the dumpsite since they had no alternative land.
plastic pollution at nakuru sewage treatment plant, next to lake nakuru national park. photo byjames wakibiasince the most visible problem at the dumpsite was plastic, i decided to address plastic pollution. it became a hobby: i used every medium i had to share information on the negative impact of plastic bags. i wrote articles and letters to editors; i posted comments on my social media platforms. i literally became obsessed with demanding a complete ban on single-use plastic bags. 
in 2015, with a group called inthestreetsofnakuru, we presented a petition in the county assembly of nakuru, demanding that the county government discuss ways to control plastic pollution. i wanted nakuru county to be the first to ban plastic bags. that did not happen, but at least people were talking. in august 2017 the government of kenya announced the ban on plastic bags. it was great news. 
plastic pollution at nakuru sewage treatment plant, next to lake nakuru national park. photo byjames wakibiado you have a day job, or are you a full-time activist? 
my passion is photography. photography has helped me to see. it has given me the courage to stop and shoot, and later question. i earn my living and provide for my family through photography. 
what do you think of the plastic bag ban? will there be a plastic bottle recycling scheme or ban soon?
the plastic bag ban was the way to go. kenya made a major stride by banning single-use plastic bags. i would love all countries choking with plastic waste to start phasing out single-use plastic bags, straws, cups, forks, etc., and encourage other nations to emulate kenya by banning all single-use plastic bags.
i believe plastic bottles should, and can, be recycled, and the government should ensure that all plastic bottles are standardized so that we have a quality bottle that can be easily recycled. 
do you have a message for manufacturers?
manufacturers and stakeholders in the plastics business, including beverage companies, should be compelled by law to create environmental cleanup funds. most only care about the profits they get, not about the environment their plastics are polluting. let manufacturers find eco-friendly packaging for their products. they are a major employer but at the same time there is alternative and more sustainable packaging.  
do you have any messages for politicians?
i think the biggest hindrance to environmental protection is when politicians have vested interests. for example, many politicians are shareholders of companies engaged in lumbering, or are shareholders in companies dealing with plastics. so it becomes hard for them to support any initiatives calling for sustainable forestry or a ban on single-use plastics. that's a big problem holding back many governments. 
i’m glad the government of kenya has called for massive tree planting across the country. i hope they will walk the talk. so my message to politicians, especially lawmakers, is to support environmental initiatives to safeguard the welfare of this nation.
plastic pollution at nakuru sewage treatment plant, next to lake nakuru national park. photo byjames wakibiawhat has your role in cleanups been? 
i have organized a few cleanups but participation cannot be compared with that of the county government. they can reach more people. the number of people coming out to participate in such cleanups is massive and means that kenyans are beginning to appreciate a clean environment. i hope more such drives continue all over the republic. 
my role is basically to share information and lobby for such activities across the country. i hope that through them i can change people’s perceptions, so they can also emulate what is being done. 
how do you get your message out?
i mostly rely on social media, especially facebook and twitter. i find these platforms very powerful and engaging. my twitter accounts are @jameswakibia and @banplasticsnow, and i blog on facebook and medium. i also plan to register my own organization, so that i can expand my work to stop plastic pollution across this beautiful country.
#beatplasticpollution is the theme of world environment day 2018.

today, hundreds of millions of people struggle with energy poverty. one in ten people lack electricity to light their homes, refrigerate their food or keep cool in rising temperatures.
in a world where the technology to provide everyone with power has been available for many decades, this is a global shame. we must provide energy equity and connectivity for all, as we have promised in the sustainable development goals. but we must also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, otherwise, these same people will suffer the most on a hothouse earth.
net-zero commitments are growing. but we are still behind on the goals of the paris agreement. at the same time – driven by population growth, increasing wealth and a warming planet – billions of new appliances will be added to the global stock by 2050.
to ensure that rising power demand does not send greenhouse gas emissions spiralling out of control, we have to prioritize clean, renewable energy. but this must be accompanied by concerted efforts to improve the energy efficiency of every appliance and building that draws power.
increasing energy efficiency is an important short-term measure to reduce power demand while we shift to renewables. it is an important long-term measure to avoid demand exceeding supply when the global grid runs on renewables. it can help us rebuild our greener and more-vibrant economies after covid-19. according to the international energy agency, building efficiency retrofits and efficient new buildings can create 9-30 jobs per million dollars of spending. and, of course, providing clean and efficient energy will reduce poverty and air pollution, help with education and livelihoods and provide many other social benefits.
friends, these benefits are within touching distance. if we adopt effective policies, we can end energy poverty and make the energy matrix climate-friendly in a single generation. 
we are already on our way to achieving these goals. many countries are already acting. 
rwanda was the first developing economy to start implementing a national action plan on sustainable cooling. ghana recently launched a financial mechanism that supports the purchase of highly efficient cooling products. pakistan recently implemented its first mandatory minimum energy performance standards, or meps, for lighting products.
however, many countries are still behind the curve. to bridge the policy gap, unep’s united for efficiency’s initiative works with governments, regional centres, international organizations, private sector and ngos on integrated policy approaches that foster markets for energy-efficient equipment.  such approaches combine meps, labelling and consumer outreach programmes, new financing mechanisms and environmental and health considerations.
there are many roads to the top of the energy efficiency mountain. the global alliance for buildings and construction (globalabc) roadmap (2020-2025) can help countries reach net-zero carbon emission buildings. governments and businesses can adopt green procurement, sourcing only the most eco-efficient products and services, saving billions of dollars each year in the process. as an example, unep is supporting the governments of cambodia and vietnam in developing national roadmaps. in india, we support green procurement guidelines for air conditioning units, and heat mapping, looking towards a broader sustainable urban development strategy.
but energy sustainability cannot be achieved at the country level alone. we need to work together to send effective signals to consumers and manufacturers to increase efficiency. 
low-carbon energy and energy efficiency need to be pursued together, not independently, as is the case in many countries and regions. regional harmonization of regulations is a powerful pathway to high efficiency: reducing trade barriers, expanding the size of markets and lowering prices.
we have the platforms to increase coordination - platforms like the cool coalition, the global abc, and the g20’s super-efficient equipment and appliance deployment initiatives. unep is also pleased to be working with the iea and uk to bring energy efficiency in the global spotlight at the 26th un climate change conference of the parties (cop26), through the energy transition campaign.
friends,
the benefits of investing in sustainable and efficient energy are too numerous to be ignored. to take advantage of all benefits, we need to act urgently, ambitiously and together. in so doing, we can bring real and positive change for our planet while improving the lives of billions of people.
thank you.

Stopping fish bombing","https://oceanconference.un.org/coa/CoralReefs, https://oceanconference.un.org/commitments/?id=16712), https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg14, https://oceanconference.un.org/coa/CoralReefs","sabah, malaysia: george woodman’s first experience of fish bombing in sabah—a malaysian state in the northern part of the island of borneo—was in 1994 during an underwater survey of the area’s renowned coral reefs.
“it's not so much something you hear, but something you feel,” said woodman, a founding member of the hong kong-based non-governmental organization stop fish bombing!. 
“at a range of a few kilometres, a fish bomb going off feels like you've been kicked in the chest by a horse,” he said.  
over the course of the four-month survey carried out by divers, his team experienced this extremely destructive fishing practice a few times a week.
also known as blast or dynamite fishing, fish bombing is one of the most destructive forms of fishing because it indiscriminately kills any animal in the blast area—from fish eggs and plankton to whales and dolphins—and devastates corals.
fish bombing = reef bombing
fish bombing is an escalating threat to coral reefs, and to the people who depend on them for their livelihoods. it destroys fish habitats among reefs already threatened by overfishing and climate change. 
“blast fishing is an extremely short-sighted fishing method because it destroys the coral reef on which fisherfolk depend,” said jerker tamelander, head of the coral reef unit at un environment.
“it is also extremely dangerous to the fisherfolk themselves because bombs can explode prematurely,” he said. 
not only do the bombs kill all marine life around them, repeated bombings shatter the dead sub-structure of the coral and create dead zones that destroy biodiversity and ecosystems by removing the main life support system for many species. 
the practice is illegal worldwide, but it persists due to the challenges of detecting, responding and catching the perpetrators.
in sabah, action is urgently needed: “blast fishing in the past years has badly affected the marine ecosystems,” said terence lim of sabah and a founding member of stop fish bombing!. “if this is left unchecked we will not only lose the ability to produce wild fish stock but it will dramatically effect the tourism industry which now generates the second highest revenue for sabah.”
stopping the bombs
stop fish bombing! has collaborated with californian tech company shotspotter to adapt their gunshot location technology to detect fish bombs underwater. 
“fortunately, we now have the technology to detect and locate fish bombs as they happen, and publish this information on tablets and phones for access by everyone,” said woodman. 
the use of this acoustic sensing and location technology, combined with existing and emerging surveillance and monitoring systems, offers the possibility of building an effective global detection system and thus an opportunity to suppress or even eradicate fish bombing within a short time. 
this project was registered as a voluntary commitment by the state government of sabah as part of a community of ocean action (coa) formed following the united nations oceans conference in 2017.
“i'm delighted to be involved as part of a team of dedicated scientists, engineers, media professionals, conservationists, politicians and others who have put their efforts into developing solutions,” said woodman.
unfortunately, techniques for restoring reefs are still in their infancy, and are not cost-effective alternatives, so prevention is the only reasonable option. 
“fish bombing is the poster child of destructive fishing. everyone understands that it's illegal and that it needs to stop: this is the first step on the way to stopping it,” he adds.
helping communities help themselves
change is possible through soft measures such as community development, and hard measures such as enforcement.
getting communities involved in enforcement has proved effective in maximizing reach and minimizing cost. it also provides high-quality data to allow people in marine protected areas affected by blast fishing to objectively assess the issues and ways to solve them.
failing to address fish bombing ultimately exacerbates poverty, and turns an environmental problem into a security risk, because food supplies dwindle, and a disempowered rural population with expertise in home-made explosives pose a risk to future security.

the project has already led to a collaboration between stop fish bombing!, the anti fish bombing committee of sabah government and other local partners including sabah environment trust, wwf malaysia, reefcheck malaysia, and dhi malaysia to develop a new policy document to help sabah government deliver actions supporting sustainable development goal 14: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

“the 2020 deadline specified by goal 14 for eradication of destructive fishing is an incentive for us all,” said woodman.
the project has also led to discussions with the united states government on developing law-enforcement capacity to stop fish bombing in sabah and the region, by combining spatial data to identify fish bomb locations with surveillance data such as radar positions. 
tamelander added: “initiatives such as this one in malaysia that allow us to identify where the blasts are most prevalent, and then work with local communities to prevent blast fishing from occurring in the first place are critical in solving this problem.”

 
stop fish bombing! brings together professionals from teng hoi conservation organization, an non-government organisation in hong kong, shotspotter, a tech company based in california and scubazoo, a media company based in sabah. for more visit: stopfishbombing

Environmental rights and governance

A bid to strengthen environmental democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean","https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-environment-calls-governments-and-business-promote-protect-and, https://www.cepal.org/en/subsidiary-bodies/reunion-comite-negociacion-principio-10-america-latina-caribe, https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/environmental-governance","latin america and the caribbean – a region rich in wildlife and natural resources – is also the deadliest part of the world for environmental defenders. sixty per cent of the 197 people killed in 2017 for defending their right to land and a healthy environment worked in the region, according to the watchdog group global witness.
“the majority of conflicts that threaten the lives of environmental defenders are ultimately linked to mining, major infrastructure projects or the expansion of the agricultural frontier,” says leo heileman, un environment’s regional director for latin america and the caribbean.
“that is why mechanisms of prior consultation and public participation and specific legislation are key to prevent these conflicts. we call it environmental democracy,” heileman explains.
on 4 march, 24 countries of latin america and the caribbean took a historic stand that many hope will help stop the wave of violence against defenders: they adopted the world's first binding agreement on environmental democracy.  
""this is an opportunity to give environmental rights the same legal standing as human rights at the global level.""

the treaty, formally called the regional agreement on principle 10, was adopted in san josé, costa rica, after four years of negotiations.
the legal instrument aims to protect people’s rights regarding access to information, public participation and justice on environmental matters, derived from principle 10 of the rio declaration on environment and development, which was adopted during the rio + 20 conference in 2012.
“the great merit of this regional agreement lies in placing equality at the centre of rights of access and, therefore, of the environmental sustainability of development,” stated alicia bárcena, executive secretary of the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean, the united nations regional organization that acts as technical secretariat of this agreement.
“this is a second-generation accord that links the environment to human rights and rights of access, and which undoubtedly will contribute to the attainment of the 2030 agenda,” bárcena said.

(source: daniel cima/cidh)this pioneering agreement will be open to the signature of all of the region’s 33 countries at the united nations headquarters in new york, from september 2018 until september 2020. it will be subject to the ratification, acceptance or approval of the states that have signed it.
the first conference of the parties will be convened by the un economic commission for latin america no later than one year after the agreement has entered into force.
“this is an opportunity to give environmental rights the same legal standing as human rights at the global level,” says heileman, who participated in the adoption ceremony in san josé. 
“the people have the right to be listened to. if we fail to support the efforts to conserve the environment and protect defenders, it will be impossible for us to fully enjoy human rights, as well as to achieve the sustainable development goals,” heileman argues. 
un environment provided support to the regional negotiations on this instrument, and on 6 march announced in geneva a new global initiative against the ongoing intimidation and murder of environmental defenders.
the un environmental rights initiative aims to help people to better understand their rights and how to defend them, assist governments to better safeguard environmental rights, and mobilize the private sector to champion the rights of everyone to a clean and healthy environment.
