acute hunger is set to soar in over 20 countries in the coming months without urgent and scaled-up assistance, warn the un's food and agriculture organization (fao) and world food programme (wfp) in a new report issued today.  yemen, south sudan and northern nigeria top the list and face catastrophic levels of acute hunger, with families in pockets of south sudan and yemen already in the grip of or at risk of starvation and death according to the hunger hotspots report.  although the majority of the affected countries are in africa, acute hunger is due to rise steeply in most world regions - from afghanistan in asia, syria and lebanon in the middle east, to haiti in latin america and the caribbean.already, over 34 million people are grappling with emergency levels of acute hunger (ipc4) - meaning they are one step away from starvation - across the world.""the magnitude of suffering is alarming. it is incumbent upon all of us to act now and to act fast to save lives, safeguard livelihoods and prevent the worst situation,"" said fao director-general qu dongyu.""in many regions, the planting season has just started or is about to start. we must run against the clock and not let this opportunity to protect, stabilize and even possibly increase local food production slip away,"" urged qu. ""we are seeing a catastrophe unfold before our very eyes. famine - driven by conflict, and fuelled by climate shocks and the covid-19 hunger pandemic - is knocking on the door for millions of families,"" said wfp executive director david beasley.""we urgently need three things to stop millions from dying of starvation: the fighting has to stop, we must be allowed access to vulnerable communities to provide life-saving help, and above all we need donors to step up with the us$ 5.5 billion we are asking for this year,"" he added.conflict, covid-19 amongst key drivers of acute food insecurityone or a mix of the following factors are behind the projected rise in acute food insecurity in the 20 hunger ""hotspots"" between march and july 2021. conflict or other forms of violence may protract or is likely to increase in parts of afghanistan, central african republic, central sahel, ethiopia, northern nigeria, northern mozambique, somalia, south sudan and the sudan. covid-19 will continue to impact numerous countries around the world, leaving them highly vulnerable to economic shocks. latin america is the region hardest hit by economic decline and will be the slowest to recover. in the middle east, yemen, syria and lebanon are seriously affected by a rapid currency depreciation and skyrocketing inflation.  climate extremes and la niña-driven weather will likely continue in april and may, driving hunger in several parts of the world - from afghanistan, madagascar to the horn of africa. desert locust outbreaks in east africa and on the red sea coast remain of concern. in southern africa, in parts of angola, botswana, namibia, zambia and zimbabwe, african migratory locusts threaten to ravage the summer crops.increasingly constrained access in some countries to help people in need has been making things worse.urgent, at-scale action needed to stop rising hunger and risk of faminethe report recommends critical short-term actions in each hunger hotspot to address existing and future needs.these range from scaling up food and nutrition assistance, distributing drought-tolerant seeds, treating and vaccinating livestock to rolling out cash-for-work schemes, rehabilitating water-harvesting structures and increasing income opportunities for vulnerable communities.agricultural production is possible and essential, especially where access is constrained and people are even more reliant on local production.earlier this month, fao and wfp called for us$ 5.5 billion to swiftly scale up actions and avert famine through a combination of humanitarian food assistance, cash and emergency livelihoods interventions.hunger hotspots - up closepeople in south sudan, yemen and northern nigeria remain most at risk of rising and dangerously high acute food insecurity. in burkina faso, food security has slightly improved since last october, but the situation is still very concerning.in south sudan, in parts of jonglei state, people were likely already grappling with famine last october and november, and will continue to do so through this april-july lean season. fao and wfp call for urgent and at-scale action now to stop likely widespread starvation and death, as well as a complete collapse of livelihoods in these areas. over 7 million people across south sudan are projected to fall into crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity, including over 100,000 at catastrophe level (ipc5), during april-july - 700,000 more since the same period last year.in yemen, continued violence and economic decline as well as severe disruptions to the humanitarian response are likely to persist over the coming months.in al jawf, amran and hajjah governorates, the number of people in catastrophe level of food insecurity is estimated to triple - reaching 47,000 in june 2021, up from 16,000 in october-december 2020.with already highly vulnerable populations, severe malnutrition, rising displacement and the deteriorating economic situation, the risk of famine in yemen is increasing.overall, over 16 million yemenis are expected to face high levels of acute food insecurity by june 2021, an increase of some 3 million since the end of last year.  in conflict-hit northern nigeria, projections for the june-august lean season show that the number of people in emergency level of acute food insecurity is likely to almost double - to over 1.2 million - since the same period last year. in the next six months, food and nutrition insecurity is set to rise considerably in northern nigeria with some 13 million people affected unless food and livelihood assistance is scaled up.burkina faso has seen a slight improvement in food security since june 2020 due to a good agricultural season and people in remote and previously, inaccessible areas reached with food. but the situation remains very worrying and needs close monitoring as violence is likely to continue pushing people into acute food insecurity.some 2.7 million burkinabe are projected to face high acute food insecurity between june and august 2021 - a sharp increase from 700,000 in 2019, before violence escalated in the west african nation. other countries identified by the report as amongst the worst hunger hotspots - where life-threatening hunger is on the rise - are afghanistan, the democratic republic of the congo, ethiopia, haiti, the sudan and syria.note: this report is part of a series of analyses produced under the global network against food crises initiative. the report's hunger projections are based on the latest ipc and cadre harmonisé analyses. the latest global number of people in acute food insecurity will be revealed in the 2021 global report on food crises to be issued in april 2021.",2021-04-16

""the world is home to more than 1.1 billion girls under the age of 18, who have the potential of becoming the largest generation of female leaders, entrepreneurs and change-makers ever seen for the better future. yet, women and girls continue to face persistent structural constraints that prevent them from fully developing their potential and hinder their efforts of improving their lives as well as their households and communities,"" said fao director-general qu dongyu. ""women and girls can play a crucial role in the response to the covid-19 pandemic and in particular in transforming our agri-food systems. we all need to work together to spark the necessary changes to empower women and girls, particularly those in rural areas,"" he added. ""it is essential that women are not only in more leadership positions, but that they are consulted and listened to, and integrated in all spheres and stages of pandemic response and recovery,"" said gilbert f. houngbo, president of ifad. ""investing in rural women's leadership and involving them more in creating our post-covid future is critical to ensure their perspectives and needs are adequately considered, so that we can build back better food systems where there is equal access to nutritious food and decent livelihoods."" ""women and girls make up half of our global community and it's time this was reflected in leadership positions at every level,"" said david beasley, executive director of wfp. ""we know from our work around the world that when women and girls have better access to information, resources and economic opportunities, and are free to make their own decisions, hunger rates fall and nutrition improves not only for themselves but also their families, communities and countries.""  women's leadership is particularly important in rural areas of developing countries, where the voices of the 1.7 billion women and girls who live there are often overlooked. sixty percent of women in south asia and sub-saharan africa work in agriculture - yet they have less access to resources and services than men, including land, finance, training, inputs and equipment. in addition to their agricultural work, women are overburdened with domestic chores and caring for their families - roles that have increased during the covid-19 pandemic. at the same time, women are more negatively affected by the social and economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, including losing livelihoods and experiencing decreases in their personal incomes. ensuring that women have a greater voice is not only a matter of gender equality. women leaders can advocate for women to have better access to and control over assets and productive inputs, thus boosting their productivity and incomes, leading to food security and increasing their employment opportunities and real wages. research shows that if women farmers had the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase yields by 20 to 30 percent and total agricultural output by 2.5 to 4 percent, lifting 100 to 150 million people out of hunger. fao works to strengthen rural women's engagement and leadership in agri-food systems. fao also engages with farmers' organizations to ensure that rural women's voices are heard and promotes gender-transformative approaches to challenge unfair socio-cultural norms in rural communities. moreover, fao supports governments to adopt policies and strategies addressing the needs and aspirations of rural women and girls, enabling them to participate in decision-making and assume leadership positions. this also implies enhancing women's leadership skills and self-confidence and raising gender awareness within national and local institutions. within the organization, fao has established a women's committee providing an inclusive, safe space that reflects the diverse and energetic nature of fao's female workforce. the organization also created incentives for career prospects for female staff and for achieving gender parity at all levels and across all job categories. since 2009, ifad has implemented a <U+0091>household methodologies' approach to reinforce the equal role and decision-making capacity of women within households, groups and communities. evidence from uganda, rwanda, kyrgyzstan and other countries has shown that women who take part in the programme take up leadership roles in their organizations and communities, and have a greater voice in decision-making in their households. this has led to greater agricultural productivity.  food security and gender inequality are closely linked with disadvantages beginning at a young age. in many countries boys and girls have very different childhoods. boys eat first, are given more food than their sisters, do less housework and marry later. for girls, marriage and not school work can dominate their childhoods. wfp's work in achieving gender equality begins at school where support or implementation of school feeding programmes in more than 70 countries contributes to increased school attendance of girls. this provides them greater access to education, reduces the risk of child marriage and other forms of gender-based violence, and increases future livelihood and leadership opportunities for girls.  note to editors the event women's leadership in a covid-19 world for a better future - will be webcast on monday, 8 march at 14:30 - 16:00 cet. register here asel kuttubaeva, an expert in the economic empowerment of rural women in kyrgyzstan, kehkashan basu, a youth environment advocate from canada, and rea abada chiongson, an expert on gender and justice, are among the event participants who will reflect on how women leaders can bring their experiences, perspectives and skills to ensure equitable and sustainable pandemic response and recovery.",2021-04-16

""we must urgently change such trends. protecting and restoring land - better use it - can reduce forced migration, improve food security and spur economic growth. it can also help us to address the global climate emergency.""        simple solutions - great impact the fao director-general emphasized that in order to cope with droughts and to reverse desertification, in addition to geospatial technologies, farmers can also benefit from very simple solutions.  in this regard, he cited the 1 million cisterns project to storage rainfall as a good example. ""this is very simple. you store the rainfall water under your house making it available for drinking and for animals all year round,"" he said. also in the sahel region, fao and partners are supporting the african union to establish the great green wall- africa's flagship initiative to combat land degradation, desertification and drought, the fao chief said. the plan is to surround the sahara with a wide belt of vegetation, trees and bushes in order to green and protect the agricultural landscape, preventing the desert from advancing.  ""this measure is helping us to stop desertification which is one of the main reasons of growing conflict between pastoralists and farmers,"" he added. leveraging technologies to combat drought - new wapor version launched  the development of innovative applications and portals in recent years can bring accessible and actionable information directly to the farmers' hands. fao supports countries in raising awareness and building capacity on such tools to strengthen resilient agricultural practices.  today fao launched a revamped version of wapor, an open-access database tapping near real time satellite data to monitor land and water productivity in africa and the near east. data from wapor, initially launched in 2017, helps policy makers and farmers to make informed decisions to be better prepared for drought and increase agricultural production with less water use. the updated version 2.0 offers better methodology and covers three additional countries with 100 metre resolution data: iraq, sudan and niger. with recent additions, the total amount of countries covered by this resolution has increased from 18 to 21. the government of the netherlands allocated $2.5 million for the further development of the wapor database and its expansion to other areas over the two-year period (2019 - 2020).   fao and the new development bank enhance collaboration   fao and the new development bank (ndb) have agreed to step up joint efforts to help countries achieve the sustainable development goals, with a special focus on safeguarding water and soil resources as well as fighting against desertification. the formal agreement was signed today before the start of the ceremony by fao director-general josé graziano da silva and new development bank president kundapur vaman kamath.  graziano da silva noted that the mou will facilitate greater collaboration in areas of mutual interest such as food and agriculture, agricultural and rural infrastructure and sustainable rural development, investment and sdg water sector monitoring, among others. k.v. kamath highlighted that ""this mou represents another important step in solidifying what has already proven to be an active and fruitful partnership between ndb and fao."" ""the knowledge sharing engagements which we have implemented to date have been particularly helpful in enhancing the bank's approach to ensure that our projects can deliver transformative results in line with our member countries' development needs,"" he added.  the ndb is a multilateral development bank, established by brazil, russia, india, china, and south africa to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects. the high-level seminar ""counting crops and drops: let's grow the future together"", organized by fao in cooperation with the netherlands, aims to present tools, methodologies and policies for improved agricultural resilience to drought. the aim is to reduce the vulnerability of communities and promote sustainable natural resources management towards water and food security.",2021-04-16

""keeping international waters healthy and preserving their rich biodiversity have long been a challenge for these marine areas that do not fall under the responsibility of any one country,"" said maria helena semedo, fao's deputy director-general, climate and natural resources. ""the program has brought together a broad and unique partnership to tackle this challenge by promoting the sustainable management of fishery resources and ecosystem-based practices, with some outstanding results. we hope to expand this initiative to continue safeguarding our marine biodiversity and contributing to the global goals and aspirations of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the post-2020 global biodiversity framework,"" added semedo.  the gef-fao program's achievements at a glance: eight out of 13 major commercial tuna stocks no longer experience overfishing between 2014 to 2019, the number of major tuna stocks experiencing overfishing went down from 13 to five. this means eight fish stocks are now being rebuilt to reach a healthy level.  to make this happen, the common oceans abnj program brought together scientists and fishery managers to develop sustainable and transparent tuna harvest strategies and processes based on computer simulation exercises. this then helped them set and apply more sustainable tuna catch limits. every year, nearly 6 million tonnes of tuna species are fished worldwide. the annual value of the business is almost $12 billion. the strong demand, combined with the excessive number of fishing vessels, meant that tuna stocks were under immense pressure. bycatch and marine pollution reduced  adjustments to fishing gear - such as placing the gillnets two metres deeper - as well as training in how to protect threatened species have helped save marine mammals, mainly dolphins and sea turtles. for example, between 2013 to 2018, the mortality rate of marine mammals caught by pakistani gillnet fisheries in the northern arabian sea was reduced by 98 percent - from 12,000 in 2013 to less than 200 in 2018. bycatch reduction was also made possible thanks to an uptake in non-entangling and ocean-friendly fish aggregating devices - so-called fads - that are used to attract fish. prior to the program, there were no fad-guidelines in place for the atlantic, indian, eastern and pacific or western & central pacific oceans. in 2019, all of them had fad-guidelines. the program developed and tested non-entangling and ocean-friendly fad-designs, and carried out workshops with over 2,500 fishers from 22 countries about bycatch mitigation techniques. to bring down further plastic pollution at sea, studies are ongoing on the use of biodegradable materials for fads. eighteen new vulnerable marine ecosystems established  between 2014 and 2019, the program helped to establish and protect vulnerable marine ecosystems in 18 new areas - home to deep-sea species such as corals and sponges. this means these areas have been closed to fishing.  two of the sites are in the pacific ocean, five in the southern indian ocean, one in the southern pacific ocean, seven in the international waters around antarctica and three in the mediterranean.  raising awareness on ocean issues to strengthen decision-making sharing experiences, showcasing innovative solutions and gaining a deeper understanding of the complex issues at stake in international waters, the program also established a group of abnj regional leaders.  connecting representatives and decision-makers from 34 countries and across various sectors strengthened their ability to participate in the ongoing negotiations for a new international legally-binding instrument under the united nations convention on the law of the sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (bbnj).  the partnership behind the program fao worked with the united nations environment program (unep), the world bank, world wide fund (wwf), tuna and deep-sea regional fisheries management organizations, civil society, national governments, the private sector and non-governmental organizations - all in all over 60 partners - to roll out the gef-funded program. to address the critical nexus between environment and sustainable food systems, gef is an increasingly important partner for fao with an emphasis on innovation, private sector and integrated systems-based solutions. today, fao manages a gef portfolio worth nearly $900 million and representing over 190 projects in more than 130 countries.  discussions are underway at the abnj global steering committee meeting (29-30 january) in rome to extend the program - all with the aim of continuing to strengthen governance in international waters and reinforce measures to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing (iuu), and improve coordination amongst all those who have an interest in the sustainable use of the international waters.",2021-04-16

""we need better data to better understand the path we need to take to get to our destination,"" said fao chief economist maximo torero. ""knowing more about where we are and how slowly or quickly we are moving will help us focus our efforts and actions to target interventions to achieve sdgs.""the unprecedented global health crisis, with associated economic and social impacts, is ""making the achievement of these sdg targets even more challenging,"" according to the report, ""tracking progress on food and agriculture-related sdg indicators 2020"".hunger, as well as other forms of food insecurity, are rising, and the pandemic has disrupted longer-term practices from conserving genetic resources as well as immediate operations such as national agricultural censuses, which are key both to identifying immediate needs and nudging the world's farmers to more sustainable practices. these censuses have been delayed, postponed or suspended in more than half of the 150 countries canvassed. around one in four countries say that covid-19 has disrupted national statistical agencies, with ""nearly all"" key data collection being adversely affected and vastly complicating fao's work as the custodian agency for 21 sdg indicators and a contributing agency to another five. the report assesses current trends, finding many stagnating - including the hunger benchmark known as prevalence of undernourishment used to track sdg target 2.1 - or even deteriorating - such as the broader food insecurity experience scale used for the same target. many of the indicators, particularly for measuring smallholder labor productivity and incomes with the aim of doubling them by 2030, suffer from inadequate data to assess both current status and progress. ""members can rely on fao to help work through the often very substantial methodological complexity and pursue harmonized and comparable results that will enable the necessary acceleration of efforts to achieve the sdgs, as we enter the crucial decade of action culminating in 2030,"" said pietro gennari, fao's chief statistician. ""and while the general assessment is concerning, it's also important to note positive trends, such as improved water use efficiency in southern asia, increases in plant genetic resource conservation efforts in northern africa, progress towards sustainable forest management, and some improvement in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing .""innovation can trump disruption""the covid-19 crisis makes the job more difficult but is also an opportunity to find new ways to work smarter, faster and harder,"" said torero , who along with gennari presented the report virtually in geneva today. fao  has set up a big data laboratory and tool to gather real-time information for a series of indicators, a food price monitoring and analysis tool, as well as the hand in hand geospatial platform,  and is also increasing its efforts to bring all data public. the organization is exploiting alternative data sources to help members assess in real-time the impact of the pandemic disruptions on food systems and also to overcome the current limitations on data collection in the field. satellite imagery is being used to identify and monitor risks of disruption on crop production and value chains. machine-learning models have been developed to calibrate and classify crop prospects, and these are integrated with other data sets  - including government restriction measures and trends on the impact ofcovid-19, to inform evidence-based decision-making. some of the key findingsagricultural productivity data are scarce, but indications are that small-scale food producers lag behind their larger peers. data on smallholder incomes are relatively more abundant, but show that in most countries, smallholder incomes are less than half of those of larger producers.global holdings of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture rose to 5.43 million in 2019 from 4.21 million in 2005. but efforts to secure crop diversity for crop wild relatives and underutilized crop species continue to be insufficient.  the number of livestock breeds with sufficient genetic material stored to allow them to be reconstituted in case of extinction rose 10-fold in the decade to 2019. but they still amount to only 101 of the roughly 7 600 breeds reported around the world, some 73 percent of which are at risk of extinction. gender equality, investigated through the lens of women's land tenure, is far from realized, and legal provisions in many countries do not adequately protect the rights of women to land. only 12 percent of assessed countries guarantee a very high degree of such protection.both forests and the sustainability of global fish stocks continue to decline, though at a slower pace than before. government investment in agriculture, measured as a share of gdp, has declined globally by around a third since 2001, led by sharp drops - from high levels - in much of asia.""working together, we need to work together to find innovative ways to accelerate the information needed to catalyze the changes the world has pledged to achieve,"" said torero.click here for the full report.",2021-04-16

ensure nutritious meals for school children; and provide producers with access to funding.ato oumer hussien, ethiopia's minister of agriculture highlighted how hand-in-hand fitted in with one of his country's priorities: ""the development of integrated agro-industries to enhance market-orientated agricultural production, create employment opportunity and ensure inclusive development"".""we need to ensure farmers are key players along the value chain and have access to financial services,"" said ethiopia's minister, noting that hand-in-hand is an important tool that his country can now deploy to develop inclusive food systems.anxious jongwe masuka, zimbabwe's minister of lands, agriculture and rural resettlement noted that the current challenges his country was facing - including drought and covid-19 - called for ""credible poverty alleviation initiatives"" such as hand-in-hand. the initiative also comes at a time when zimbabwe has just finalised its agriculture and food systems transformation strategy, he added.coming together the hand-in-hand initiative's importance was highlighted by other speakers, including maria do valle ribeiro, un resident coordinator for zimbabwe; martien van nieuwkoop, the world bank's global director for agriculture and food; and john cordaro, special representative food security, nutrition and safety at mars incorporated - who represented the private sector. ribeiro welcomed fao's inclusive hand-in-hand initiative, stressing the importance of coordinated action. van nieuwkoop spoke about the importance of big data, noting that this was an area that the world bank and fao were strengthening together.cordaro stressed that ""no single entity can resolve food insecurity"", adding: ""we must expect and prepare for crises such as covid-19"". in relation to hand-in-hand, cordaro highlighted how mars incorporated can bring its expertise to support countries address their specific food safety challenges.the civil society was represented by christiana saiti louwa, co-chair world forum of fisher people's.""the path of agricultural transformation cannot be solely market-oriented. it is vital that elements of environmental sustainability, climate change resilience, and the building of the african food sovereignty be integrated in our vision of peace, justice, and abundance for our motherland,"" said louwa.food security and nutrition in africamany speakers noted their concern about the state of food security and nutrition in africa.the covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing food insecurity and malnutrition in many african countries. in recent years, climate change, conflict, economic slowdowns, transboundary animal diseases and pests such as desert locusts and fall armyworm have corroded livelihoods and pushed more people into hunger.africa is home to 250 million undernourished people. in percentage terms, it is the hardest hit region and becoming more so, with 19.1 percent of its people undernourished. on current trends, by 2030, africa will be home to more than half of the world's chronically hungry.faced with these challenges, there is an urgent need to build sustainable food systems that can withstand multiple crises. hand-in-hand initiative - the back storyhand-in-hand targets the poorest, the least developed landlocked countries, least developed small island developing states, countries in food crises, and large countries with significant hotspots of poverty. the initiative takes a multilateral approach to accelerate agricultural transformation and sustainable rural development. it works to strengthen food system capacities to deliver nutrition and healthy diets for everyone and improve household incomes to reduce extreme poverty.the initiative deploys sophisticated tools, including advanced geospatial modelling and analytics such as the geospatial platform and the data lab for statistical innovation. these provide high-quality, accessible, timely and reliable data assisting countries' informed, strategic decision-making and evidence-based policies.fao partnered with leading technology companies and public data providers to build the platform, including google, ibm, world bank - to name a few.fao is conducting ""training of trainers"" activities with its members to ensure easy access to and uptake of the hand-in-hand tools.the hand-in-hand platform also introduces a framework for monitoring and impact analysis to enable countries to establish if they are on track and on target to meet national targets for sdg 1 (end poverty) and sdg 2 (end hunger).about fao's regional conference for africahosted virtually by the government of zimbabwe and in collaboration with fao, the conference brings together over 95 ministers and government officials from 48 countries along with representatives from observer countries, donor organizations, civil society and the private sector.",2021-04-16

""soil pollution affects the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the health of our ecosystems,"" said fao deputy director-general maria helena semedo at the start of the symposium. ""the potential of soils to cope with pollution is limited; the prevention of soil pollution should be a top priority worldwide,"" she added. but even though agricultural intensification, industrial output, and urbanization continue at a rapid pace, no systematic assessment of the status of soil pollution at global level has ever been undertaken, fao's new report notes. studies conducted so far have largely been limited to developed economies, so there are massive information gaps regarding the full nature and extent of the problem, according to fao's survey of existing scientific literature. what little we do know is cause for concern, the report adds.for example, in australia, some 80,000 sites are now estimated to suffer from soil contamination. china has categorized 16 percent of all its soils <U+0097> and 19 percent of its agricultural soils <U+0097> as polluted. there are approximately 3 million potentially polluted sites in the european economic area and the west balkans. in the united states, 1,300 sites appear on that country's superfund national priorities list of pollution hot spots. numbers like these help us understand the types of dangers pollution poses to soils, but ""do not reflect the complete extent of soil pollution around the world, and highlight the inadequacy of available information and the differences in registering polluted sites across geographic regions,"" says hidden reality. the report was released today at the start of a three day-long symposium at fao headquarters, during which experts and policymakers will discuss the threat of soil pollution and begin mapping out a more cohesive international response.danger to food and healthsoil pollution often cannot be visually perceived or directly assessed, making it a hidden danger <U+0097> with serious consequences. it impacts food security both by impairing plant metabolism and thus reducing crop yields, as well as by making crops unsafe for consumption. pollutants also directly harm organisms that live in soil and make it more fertile. and of course soil contaminated with dangerous elements (for example, arsenic, lead, and cadmium), organic chemicals like pcbs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and pahs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) or pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics or endocrine disruptors pose serious risks to human health.what causes soil pollution?by far, most soil pollution is due to human activities. industrial activities including mining, smelting and manufacturing; domestic, livestock and municipal wastes; pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers used in agriculture; petroleum-derived products that are released into or break-down in the environment; fumes generated by transportation <U+0097> all contribute to the problem.  so-called ""emerging pollutants"" are also a growing concern. these include pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, hormones and biological pollutants; ""e-waste"" from old electronics; and the plastics that are nowadays used in almost every human endeavour. (almost no science on the fate of plastics in soils exists, observes hidden reality, while most e-waste continues to be disposed of in landfills rather than recycled.)about the symposiumthis week's event at fao represents a first step in identifying and plugging global information gaps and advancing a more cohesive international response to the threats posed by soil pollution. that includes establishing an agenda for action to promote implementation of the voluntary guidelines for sustainable management developed by fao and partners in 2016, as well as recent international commitments to better manage soil pollution. facts and figures  fao's report is a synthesis of existing scientific research on soil pollution.* noteworthy facts and figures from that research include:  production of chemicals grown rapidly in recent decades and is projected to increase annually by 3.4 percent until 2030. non-oecd countries will be much greater contributors in the future. in 2015, the european chemical industry produced 319 million tonnes of chemicals. of these, 117 million tonnes (mt) were deemed hazardous to the environment. global production of municipal solid waste was around 1.3 billion tonnes per year in 2012; it is expected to rise to 2.2 billion tonnes annually by 2025. in many world regions, levels of persistent organic pollutants in human milk are significantly above those considered safe, with a higher incidence in india and in some european and african countries. certain low- and middle-income countries have notably increased their use of pesticides over the last decade. bangladesh, for example, did so by four times, rwanda and ethiopia by over six times, and the sudan by ten times. global manure production increased 66 percent between 1961 and 2016, from 73 to 124 mt. the volume of manure applied to soils grew from 18 to 28 mt, and the amount of manure left on pasture increased from 48 to 86 mt. manure can contain high amounts of heavy metals, pathogen organisms and antibiotics. soils near roads have high levels of heavy metals, hydrocarbons, and other pollutants, posing a threat when food production occurs in adjacent areas or grazing on roadside soils takes place.  approximately 110 million mines or other unexploded pieces of ordnance are scattered across 64 countries on all continents, remnants of wars that can have deadly consequences for farmers and which can release heavy metals through weathering. almost all soil in the northern hemisphere contains radionuclides in higher concentrations than the background level <U+0097> even in remote areas, as a result of fallout from atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons and radiological events like the chernobyl accident.* see page 91 of hidden reality for a list of the sources fao surveyed.",2021-04-16

""but with a child dying every six seconds because of undernourishment related problems, hunger remains the world's largest tragedy and scandal,"" said fao director-general jacques diouf. ""this is absolutely unacceptable."" mdgs achievement difficult the continuing high global hunger level ""makes it extremely difficult to achieve not only the first millennium development goal (mdg) but also the rest of the mdgs,"" diouf warned.  ""the achievement of the international hunger reduction target is at serious risk,"" he added, further noting that recent increases in food prices, if they persist, could hamper efforts to further reduce the numbers of the world's hungry. ""vigorous and urgent action by nations and the world has been effective in helping to halt galloping hunger numbers,"" said wfp executive director, josette sheeran. ""but this is no time to relax.  we must keep hunger on the run to ensure stability and to protect lives and dignity.""flagship reportthe new hunger figure is contained in the annual flagship report, ""the state of food insecurity in the world"" (sofi) to be jointly published by fao and wfp in october. the figure was released in advance of the september 20-22 summit meeting in new york called to speed progress towards achievement of the united nations millennium development goals (mdgs), the first of which is to end poverty and hunger. last may diouf also launched a ""1 billionhungry campaign"" aimed at inciting world leaders into taking firm and urgent action to end hunger. more than half a million people have already signed an online petition calling on politicians to make hunger reduction their top priority and a million are expected by the end of this year.  yukiko omura, vice president of ifad, said, ""the world's hungry are not just numbers. they are people <U+0097> poor women and men struggling to bring up their children and give them a better life; and they are youth trying to build a future for themselves. it is ironic that the majority of them actually live in rural areas of developing countries. indeed, over 70 percent of the world's extremely poor <U+0097> those people who live on less than us$ one a day <U+0097> live in rural areas. that's a billion people, and four out of five of them are farmers to some extent or the other.""  economic growth, lower prices the 2010 lower global hunger number resulted largely from renewed economic growth expected this year <U+0097> particularly in developing countries <U+0097> and the drop in food prices since mid-2008. the recent increase in food prices, if it continues, will create obstacles in the further reduction of hunger. of the eight millennium development goals solemnly agreed by the un in 2000, mdg 1 pledged to halve the proportion of hungry people from 20 to 10 percent by 2015.with five years to go, that proportion currently stands at 16 percent, however.  previously, in 1996, a world food summit had for the first time set a quantitative target of halving the number of hungry people from roughly 800 million in 1990-92 to about 400 million by 2015. achieving that goal would mean cutting the number of hungry by over 500 million in the next five years.  structural problem the fact that historically the number of undernourished continued to increase even in periods of high growth and relatively low prices indicates that hunger is a structural problem, fao said. it is therefore clear that economic growth, while essential, will not be sufficient to eliminate hunger within an acceptable period of time, fao added. but ""success stories do exist in africa, in asia and in latin america,"" diouf noted. these experiences need to be scaled up and replicated. globally, the 2010 hunger figure marked a decline of 9.6 percent from the 2009 level. this reduction was mostly concentrated in asia, where 80 million fewer people were estimated to be going hungry this year. in sub-saharan africa the drop was much smaller - about 12 million - and one out of three people there would continue to be undernourished. key findings other key findings of the report included:  <U+0095> two thirds of the world's undernourished live in just seven countries <U+0097> bangladesh, china, the democratic republic of congo, ethiopia, india, indonesia and pakistan.  <U+0095> the region with the most undernourished people continues to be asia and the pacific with 578 million. <U+0095> the proportion of undernourished people remains highest in sub-saharan africa at 30 percent in 2010, or 239 million. <U+0095> progress varies widely at country level. as of 2005-2007 (the most recent period for which complete data was available), the congo, ghana, mali and nigeria had already achieved mdg 1 in sub-saharan africa, and ethiopia and others are close to achieving it. however, the proportion of undernourished rose to 69 percent in the democratic republic of congo. <U+0095> in asia, armenia, myanmar and viet nam had already achieved mdg 1 and china is close to doing so. <U+0095> in latin america and the caribbean, guyana, jamaica and nicaragua had already achieved mdg1 while brazil is coming close. note to video journalists: b-roll from fao, wfp and ifad is available for download from ftp://ext-ftp.fao.org/video/2010/sofi",2021-04-16

"14","Despite the threat of COVID-19, FAO<U+0092>s work in Syria carries on <U+0096> helping farmers grow food and get back on their feet","https://www.fsinplatform.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/GRFC_2020_ONLINE_200420.pdf, http://www.fao.org/resilience/news-events/detail/en/c/1271088/","in this interview, we speak with mike robson, fao representative in syria about the covid-19 pandemic and what it could mean for a country such as syria, which is on a long road to recovery after nine years of crisis.syria has been affected by political turmoil and extreme instability since 2011. what is the situation like now, especially for rural communities? syria was one of the ten countries hardest hit by acute food insecurity in 2019, with at least 35 percent of its population in food crisis. despite this, the people of syria are resilient - even at the height of the crisis, farmers continued to grow wheat, the country's main crop. this year there have been some signs of optimism and a return to normality. peace has been restored to many parts of the country, and rains have been good so far. farmers were able to plant 70 percent of the land allocated for cereal production. however, for a significant number - many who fled their villages due to the conflict - the infrastructural damage, for example, to irrigation systems, and the loss of other basic services have continued to limit their option to return home. this is particularly true in parts of eastern syria. also, those who were able to return have lacked the seeds and inputs needed to grow food, while the majority of tractors or pumping equipment have been stolen, looted or vandalized.  among our various programmes, fao has stepped in to provide seeds to almost 15 000 families this year, targeting the most vulnerable such as former internally displaced people, allowing each family to plant a hectare of wheat - half of which is enough for an average family's needs for one year - and to sell the surplus. but our experience on the ground in north east hama, in western-central syria, showed us that many more families were in need. for example, in a village where we helped 200 families - the most vulnerable - it was evident that all 3 000 families needed assistance. elsewhere, in deir-ez-zor, close to the border with iraq, where we are restoring irrigation systems to provide water for around 5 000 households, village leaders stressed that agricultural development and or recovery programmes are urgently needed to support efforts to build peace and social stability; otherwise, they were worried about what would happen to young people in rural areas who couldn't make a living from farming. how could the pandemic make an already difficult situation even harder? who are most at risk? so far we have few confirmed cases of covid-19 in syria - though few tests are being carried out - but the risk factors are high, and the country's medical infrastructure would struggle to cope with a large outbreak. an even bigger concern is the impact of prolonged periods of lockdown on the economy and on the already precarious food security and livelihoods of millions of people.  the pandemic is like a coming storm for the people of syria. the country is currently operating a 6 pm to 6 am curfew and movement restrictions are in place while public spaces have been closed for the past month. those working in the service sector or on daily wages are really suffering right now, and there is already anecdotal evidence of extreme hardship in both urban and rural areas.  we, at fao, are mainly concerned about how the restrictions will impact on agriculture, and food availability. we are already seeing a rise in input prices, whether due to import difficulties or opportunism on the part of the traders. for example, pesticide prices recorded a 100 percent increase in hama in recent weeks. the price of a pack of tomato seeds went up from $25 to $31 in the last two weeks in homs. also, our world food programme colleagues have been tracking food prices over the past month and saw a rise of 21 percent in the cost of the standard monthly food basket, basically what a household would buy on average per month, in march alone. equally, small livestock keepers cannot take their animals to graze, or buy feed. the markets where they would sell their animals are closed or operate under restrictions. poultry businesses have also been hit by the high cost of imported feed and a collapse in demand from restaurants. basically, the livelihoods of all of the country's approximately 1.2 million farming families are affected in some way or another by the efforts to control covid-19, though the impact is felt differently across the country. what do vulnerable communities need most now in the face of the pandemic's threats?  the first priority is to provide options so people can maintain their livelihoods and remain self-sufficient. and we need to reinforce key public health messages within our programmes. there is also an urgent need to provide farmers with seeds for planting, now for the summer crops and for the coming winter crops and vegetables, and feed for their animals. is fao able to continue its work under the circumstances? and if so, what are some of the things you and your team are doing differently? as an office, fao syria moved quickly to working from home, but we have managed to keep key elements of the programme running so far.  for example, we are helping farmers build so-called ""low tunnels"" to produce vegetable seedlings  or to repair and or build irrigation systems for their farming land. the low tunnel vegetable seedling project started in march, and this is the first time this approach to producing seedlings has been used at scale in the country. each low tunnel of 2 x 10 metres can produce enough seedlings for vegetables such as tomatoes, pepper, cucumbers and eggplant for planting by ten households. the nurseries use sprinkle irrigation, which means less water being used. we estimate that each farmer will earn an additional income from vegetable production of around  $1 000 per year. this season, the low tunnel work will benefit 700 farmers directly while providing good quality vegetable seedlings to up to 7 000, with plans to scale up considerably over the next one to two years.   while carrying out these activities, all people are practising physical distancing and, if needed, wearing masks. we have also swapped classroom-based training with training carried out outdoors in smaller groups. we are using whatsapp groups and facebook pages to speak to and share information - via video, for example - with people in our seed producer groups and our entrepreneurship programmes.   how are these new initiatives working? will they be continued post covid-19? we are moving quickly to become a more digital fao syria! as well as beating the virus, this will reduce our travel costs and our carbon footprint. i am committed to carrying forward the best of these innovations in the future, though not all technologies work as well in syria as in other countries; we only just managed to run our first zoom meeting with some help from our colleagues in the regional office and headquarters. what are some of the main challenges that fao is facing now? the biggest challenge is to ensure funding for our programmes right now. so far, donors have been very understanding of the constraints we are working with now, and our core supporters understand the relevance of our work, especially during covid-19. you have been in syria since july 2018, and have worked in other countries where life is particularly difficult. how is the current situation different? the major difference right now is the movement restrictions imposed in the last months to halt the spread of covid-19. however, syria is not alone in this.  here in damascus, our international staff live with other united nations colleagues in one hotel. to help them better cope with the current circumstances, we managed to buy a tennis table just before the lockdown started. it is a great stress buster at the end of the day, and can be played in a safe way - whilst keeping distance.  mahmoud, our egyptian entrepreneurship specialist, has been a great coach.",2021-04-16
"15","Pollutants from agriculture a serious threat to world's water","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/CA0146EN, https://wsdconf2018.org/","20 june 2018, rome - water pollution from unsustainable agricultural practices poses a serious risk to human health and the planet's ecosystems, a problem often underestimated by policymakers and farmers alike, cautions a new report. in many countries the biggest source of water pollution today is agriculture <U+0097> not cities or industry <U+0097> while worldwide, the most common chemical contaminant found in groundwater aquifers is nitrate from farming, according to more people, more food, worse water? a global review of water pollution from agriculture, launched by fao and the international water management institute at a conference in tajikistan (19-22 june). modern agriculture is responsible for the discharge of large quantities of agrochemicals, organic matter, sediments and saline trading into water bodies, the report says. this pollution affects billions of people and generates annual costs exceeding billions of dollars. ""agriculture is the single largest producer of wastewater, by volume, and livestock generates far more excreta than do humans. as land use has intensified, countries have greatly increased the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers and other inputs,"" write eduardo mansur, director of fao's land and water division, and claudia sadoff, iwmi director-general, in their introduction to the report. ""while these inputs have helped boost food production, they have also given rise to environmental threats, as well as to potential human health concerns,"" they add. the agropollutants of greatest concern for human health are pathogens from livestock, pesticides, nitrates in groundwater, trace metallic elements and emerging pollutants, including antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant genes excreted by livestock. the new report represents the most comprehensive review of the dispersed scientific literature on the issue complied to date, and aims to fill information gaps and lay out policy and farm-level solutions in one consolidated reference.how agriculture affects water qualitythe boom in global agricultural productivity that followed the second world war was achieved in large part through the intensive use of inputs such as pesticides and chemical fertilizers. since 1960 the use of mineral fertilizer has grown ten times, while since 1970 global sales of pesticides climbed from around $one billion to $35 billion a year. meanwhile, the intensification of livestock production <U+0097> world livestock numbers have more than tripled since 1970 <U+0097> has seen a new class of pollutants emerge: antibiotics, vaccines and hormonal growth promoters that travel from farms through water into ecosystems and our drinking water. at the same time, water pollution by organic matter from livestock farming is now significantly more widespread than organic pollution from urban areas. and another booming sector, aquaculture (which has expanded twenty-fold since 1980) is now releasing ever greater amounts of fish excreta, uneaten feed, antibiotics, fungicides and anti-fouling agents into surface waters.what can be donewater pollution from agriculture is a complex challenge and effectively managing it requires a range of responses, according to more people, more food, worse water. the most effective way to mitigate pressure on aquatic ecosystems and rural ecologies is to limit the export of pollutants at the source or to intercept them before they reach vulnerable ecosystems. once off-farm, the costs of remediation progressively increase. one way to do this is to develop policies and incentives that encourage people to adopt more sustainable diets and limit increases in demand for food with a large environmental footprint <U+0097> for example taxes and subsidies. at the consumer level, reducing food waste can help. one study covered in the report estimated that nitrogen pollution from food waste adds up to 6.3 teragrams per year. ""traditional"" regulatory instruments will also continue to be a key tool in reducing farm outputs of pollutants. these include water quality standards; pollution discharge permits; mandatory best practices; environmental impact assessments for certain farming activities; buffer zones around farms; restrictions on agricultural practices or the location of farms; and limits on the marketing and sale of dangerous products. however, the report acknowledges that well-known principles for reducing pollution, such as <U+0091>polluter pays,' are hard to apply to non-point agricultural pollution because identifying the actual polluters is neither easy nor cheap. that means that measures that promote farmer ""buy in"" are critical to preening pollution at the source <U+0097> such as tax breaks for the adoption of practices that minimize farm export of nutrients and pesticides or payments to for ""landscape maintenance.""  on the farm, a number of best practices can reduce the export of pollutants into surrounding ecosystems, for example: minimizing the use of fertilizers and pesticides, establishing buffer zones along watercourses and farm boundaries, or improving drainage control schemes. integrated pest management, which combines the strategic use of pest-resistant crop varieties with crop rotation and the introduction of natural predators of common pests is another helpful tool on livestock operations, traditional techniques such as restoring degraded pasturelands and better managing animal diets, feed additives and medicines are needed <U+0097> while more also needs to be done with new nutrient recycling techniques and technologies, such as farm waste biodigesters. agricultural water pollution: numbers of noteirrigation is the world's largest producer in volume of wastewater (in the form of agricultural drainage).globally, around 115 million tonnes of mineral nitrogen fertilizers are applied to croplands each year. around 20 percent of these nitrogen inputs end up accumulating in soils and biomass, whereas 35 percent enters the oceans.worldwide, 4.6 million tonnes of chemical pesticides are sprayed into the environment every year.developing countries account for 25 percent of world pesticide use in farming, but 99 percent of the world's deaths due to pesticides.recent estimates that the economic impact of pesticides on non-target species (including humans) is approximately $8 billion annually in developing countries.oxygen-depletion (hypoxia) resulting from manmade nutrient overloading affects an area of 240 000 km2 globally, comprising 70 000 km2 of inland waters and 170 000 km2 of coastal areasworldwide, an estimated 24 percent of the area under irrigation is affected by salinizationcurrently, more than 700 emerging pollutants, their metabolites and transformation products, are listed as being present in the european aquatic environment.",2021-04-16

hit by chronic hunger, insecurity, climate change, the threats of a desert locust outbreak, and now the pandemic. year after year, five out of the ten countries at the bottom of the un development index are in west africa.right now, we are particularly concerned about the humanitarian crisis in central sahel - comprised of burkina faso, mali and niger. some four million people here are already facing extreme hunger and this could rise to 5.5 million people by august. just to put it in perspective - by august, in burkina faso, over two million people could be facing extreme hunger, and at the worst time - as the lean season sets in and food becomes scarcer. this number is three times higher than last year during the same period. across west africa, as of april, over 11 million people need immediate food assistance - mostly due to conflict. and this number will continue rising, potentially reaching 17 million during the lean season (june- august) if we don't respond fast.many people are not only hungry. they are also uprooted and have lost what they had. the ones i spoke to had the same story - of villages attacked; of family members killed or displaced; of homes or fields destroyed; of animals abandoned or killed. as of now, some 1.2 million people have been displaced in central sahel. if the conflict persists, more people will suffer the same fate. according to the 2020 global food crisis report, increasing violence, displacements and disrupted agriculture and trade in tandem with adverse climate in west africa and sahel countries will worsen acute food insecurity conditions in many areas this year.covid-19 could not have come at a worse time for vulnerable communities across west africa. who is most at risk from covid-19?first of all: children. malnutrition rates in the sahel are one of the highest in the world. some 2.5 million children - more than a quarter in burkina faso, mali and niger - suffer from severe and acute malnutrition. as mothers and children are the hardest hit, in general, they will also suffer the most during  the pandemic.those who are already hungry, or already hungry and displaced, will be at extreme risk.the key issue to highlight is that the pandemic is expanding during crucial months for this region - when people need to plant, move with their animals. farmers need to be able to sell their current produces but also access fields and markets to prepare for the main 2020/2021 agricultural season. pastoralists or nomadic herders need to move with their animals. governments and humanitarian actors need to assist people requiring urgent food, nutritional and emergency support during the lean season.for centuries, nomadic herders across the sahel have moved hundreds of miles every year to find pasture for their herds. this is something they do each year, especially during april-may as pastures become drier.many mauritanian herders, for example, head to mali and senegal in search of pasture.but, as borders close, nomadic herders are no longer able to move in search of fodder and water or to trade - animals can be traded for other foods or essential items.this can lead to herders losing their income as they can't sell their animals or buy what they need for them as well as potentially losing animals as some of them might not survive or might fall ill. when animals suffer, people suffer. when animals die or stop being a source of milk or meat, people go hungry. when animals are lost, so are people's livelihoods.farmers will also be affected by covid-19 due to a lower supply of fertilizers and seeds, the closure of stores and markets, and reduced assistance.the pandemic - if it spreads further - will translate into increasing threats: from more displacements to less and less access to basic social services, higher food prices, less food. are covid-19's impacts on people's food security already being felt in west africa?governments have taken measures such as physical distancing and closure of markets. these will result in market disruptions, whether for traders or buyers.covid-19's impacts are already seen in the pastoral areas. as most borders are closed, movements of herders and animals have been restricted. although the pandemic's impact on primary products' prices are not yet discernible, the fact that many people are buying main commodities in bulk could lead to a temporary increase in costs and shortages, which will be difficult to manage as/if production drops. transport is also already affected, which will impact on food and products' supply.how is fao responding?as most of west africa is already affected by other complex crises, our first priority is to safeguard and maintain our current emergency response, especially activities supporting the upcoming agricultural campaign, which will help mitigate the effects of covid-19 on food security.doing so will be particularly challenging given the operational difficulties due to the movement restrictions introduced by most countries. however, working closely with governments, the un family, and partners, we are recalibrating and finding ways to deliver.our response across the region is only funded at 20 percent, however. we urge donors and partners to ensure that the ongoing emergencies, on top of covid-19, are not forgotten.in response to covid-19, fao has been collecting information and carrying out analysis, at regional and country level, on the pandemic's likely consequences on agriculture and food security, which will feed into a global data facility. this is informing the development of national and a regional strategies as well as country specific covid-19 preparedness and response plans. several actions in these plans are already being implemented.in burkina faso, fao is launching a program, thanks to support from the central emergency response fund (cerf)of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha), to provide immediate assistance to vulnerable households living in quarantine in urban and peri-urban areas so they can access healthy and nutritious food.in senegal, fao is supporting government's efforts to fight the pandemic though awareness raising campaigns, particularly for actors along the food chain, to avoid a further spread of the pandemic. we will support small producers affected by trade disruptions, mostly women, to sell their produce, gain sufficient money and prepare for planting. and we will distribute cash and vouchers to pastoralists so they can feed their animals, and to reduce food waste and loss.in the short-term, the priorities are: support vulnerable households affected by covid-19 to access adequate food; ensure pastoralists have feed and water during the current dry season, and farmers have seeds to start planting; ensure social protection during the lean season; and maintain the markets and value chains functional so that people can buy the food they need, and at adequate prices.fao experts are also monitoring the desert locust situation, as there is some possibility of the pest's incursion into west africa towards mid-year.what should governments do?fao encourages countries to keep abreast and adapt their response plans to the consequences of the pandemic - as these become better known. what is crucial is to anticipate covid-19's impacts on agriculture, food security and the lives of vulnerable women and children. ensuring that food systems and food supply chains are maintained is one of the most important action to take at national and regional levels.on 16 april, all 55 member states of the african union (au) committed during a meeting by au-fao to supporting access to food and nutrition for africa's most vulnerable; providing social safety nets; minimizing disruptions to the safe movement and transport of essential people, and to the transport and marketing of goods and services; and keeping borders open for the food and agriculture trade. this is a first, crucial step, and fao is proud to have been part of this processes.what are the biggest challenges for fao's work if the pandemic worsens?if the pandemic worsens, as many as 50 million more people could face a food crisis in the region.this is why we are scaling up our support through local partners and actors and finding innovative ways, such as online training and remote support, to increase their capacity. we learnt during the ebola crisis that several activities can be carried out by integrating them into our regular work, whilst respecting additional measures such as health protocols. fao has activated business continuity plans across all the region with aim of ensuring the safety of its staff, partners and beneficiaries while maintaining activities running. anything else you would like to add?these are challenging times, but let's not forget that people in west africa have proven to be resilient in the face of crises. in fact, fao's and many other agencies' global approach to covid-19 is informed by lessons learned from the west africa ebola crisis.we also learnt from ebola that whilst covid-19 is primarily a health crisis, we must do everything possible to not turn this into a food crisis, and for many communities in west africa a larger food crisis.",2021-04-16
"17","As more go hungry and malnutrition persists, achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 in doubt, UN report warns","http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/","rome, 13 july 2020 - more people are going hungry, an annual study by the united nations has found. tens of millions have joined the ranks of the chronically undernourished over the past five years, and countries around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition. the latest edition of the state of food security and nutrition in the world, published today, estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 - up by 10 million from 2018, and by nearly 60 million in five years. high costs and low affordability also mean billions cannot eat healthily or nutritiously. the hungry are most numerous in asia, but expanding fastest in africa. across the planet, the report forecasts, the covid-19 pandemic could tip over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020. (flare-ups of acute hunger in the pandemic context may see this number escalate further at times.) the state of food security and nutrition in the world is the most authoritative global study tracking progress towards ending hunger and malnutrition. it is produced jointly by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), the international fund for agricultural development (ifad), the united nations children's fund (unicef), the un world food programme (wfp) and the world health organization (who).  writing in the foreword, the heads of the five agencies[i] warn that ""five years after the world committed to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, we are still off track to achieve this objective by 2030."" the hunger numbers explainedin this edition, critical data updates for china and other populous countries[ii] have led to a substantial cut in estimates of the global number of hungry people, to the current 690 million. nevertheless, there has been no change in the trend. revising the entire hunger series back to the year 2000 yields the same conclusion: after steadily diminishing for decades, chronic hunger slowly began to rise in 2014 and continues to do so. asia remains home to the greatest number of undernourished (381 million). africa is second (250 million), followed by latin america and the caribbean (48 million). the global prevalence of undernourishment - or overall percentage of hungry people - has changed little at 8.9 percent, but the absolute numbers have been rising since 2014. this means that over the last five years, hunger has grown in step with the global population.  this, in turn, hides great regional disparities: in percentage terms, africa is the hardest hit region and becoming more so, with 19.1 percent of its people undernourished. this is more than double the rate in asia (8.3 percent) and in latin america and the caribbean (7.4 percent). on current trends, by 2030, africa will be home to more than half of the world's chronically hungry.the pandemic's tollas progress in fighting hunger stalls, the covid-19 pandemic is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems - understood as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food. while it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by covid-19.[iii] the setback throws into further doubt the achievement of sustainable development goal 2 (zero hunger). unhealthy diets, food insecurity and malnutrition overcoming hunger and malnutrition in all its forms (including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity) is about more than securing enough food to survive: what people eat - and especially what children eat - must also be nutritious.  yet a key obstacle is the high cost of nutritious foods and the low affordability of healthy diets for vast numbers of families. the report presents evidence that a healthy diet costs far more than us$ 1.90/day, the international poverty threshold. it puts the price of even the least expensive healthy diet at five times the price of filling stomachs with starch only. nutrient-rich dairy, fruits, vegetables and protein-rich foods (plant and animal-sourced) are the most expensive food groups globally.    the latest estimates are that a staggering 3 billion people or more cannot afford a healthy diet. in sub-saharan africa and southern asia, this is the case for 57 percent of the population - though no region, including north america and europe, is spared. partly as a result, the race to end malnutrition appears compromised. according to the report, in 2019, between a quarter and a third of children under five (191 million) were stunted or wasted - too short or too thin. another 38 million under-fives were overweight. among adults, meanwhile, obesity has become a global pandemic in its own right. a call to action the report argues that once sustainability considerations are factored in, a global switch to healthy diets would help check the backslide into hunger while delivering enormous savings. it calculates that such a shift would allow the health costs associated with unhealthy diets, estimated to reach us$ 1.3 trillion a year in 2030, to be almost entirely offset; while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, estimated at us$ 1.7 trillion, could be cut by up to three-quarters.[iv] the report urges a transformation of food systems to reduce the cost of nutritious foods and increase the affordability of healthy diets. while the specific solutions will differ from country to country, and even within them, the overall answers lie with interventions along the entire food supply chain, in the food environment, and in the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investment policies. the study calls on governments to mainstream nutrition in their approaches to agriculture; work to cut cost-escalating factors in the production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing of food - including by reducing inefficiencies and food loss and waste; support local small-scale producers to grow and sell more nutritious foods, and secure their access to markets; prioritize children's nutrition as the category in greatest need; foster behaviour change through education and communication; and embed nutrition in national social protection systems and investment strategies.  the heads of the five un agencies behind the state of food security and nutrition in the world declare their commitment to support this momentous shift, ensuring that it unfolds ""in a sustainable way, for people and the planet.""please read the report here.[i] for fao - qu dongyu, director-general;

"19","New report shows Indigenous and Tribal Peoples <U+0091>best guardians' of forests","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb2953en, https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2430/briefing/signup/","25 march 2021, santiago, chile/rome - deforestation rates are significantly lower in indigenous and tribal territories where governments have formally recognized collective land rights, according to a new report launched today. jointly published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) and the fund for the development of indigenous peoples of latin america and the caribbean (filac), forest governance by indigenous and tribal peoples also shows that improving the tenure security of these territories is an efficient and cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions. based on a review of more than 300 studies published in the last two decades, the new report reveals for the first time the extent to which indigenous and tribal peoples in latin america and the caribbean are the best guardians of their forests when compared to those responsible for the region´s other forests. the research also suggests that their protective role is increasingly at risk, at a time when the amazon is nearing a tipping point, with worrisome impacts on rainfall and temperature, and eventual repercussions for food production and the global climate.    ""indigenous and tribal peoples and the forests in their territories play vital roles in global and regional climate action and in fighting poverty, hunger and malnutrition,"" said fao's regional representative, julio berdegué. ""their territories contain about one third of all the carbon stored in the forests of latin america and the caribbean and 14 percent of the carbon stored in tropical forests worldwide."" the best results were seen in indigenous territories that have recognized collective legal titles to their lands: between 2000 and 2012, deforestation rates in these territories in the bolivian, brazilian and colombian amazon were only one half to one third of those in other forests with similar ecological characteristics. ""almost half (45 percent) of the intact forests in the amazon basin are in indigenous territories,"" said myrna cunningham, president of filac. ""the evidence of their vital role in forest protection is crystal clear: while the area of intact forest declined by only 4.9 percent between 2000 and 2016 in the region's indigenous areas, in the non-indigenous areas it fell by 11.2 percent"". the report calls on governments to invest in projects that strengthen the role that indigenous and tribal peoples play in forest governance, bolster communal territorial rights, compensate indigenous and tribal communities for the environmental services they provide, and facilitate community forest management.  it also states the vital importance of revitalizing traditional cultures and knowledge, strengthening territorial governance as well as supporting the organizations of indigenous and tribal peoples.  indigenous  territories emit less carbon according to one of the studies analyzed in the fao/filac report, the deforestation rate inside indigenous woodlands where land property has been ensured where 2.8 times lower than outside such areas in bolivia, 2.5 times lower in brazil and 2 times less in colombia.  territories owned collectively by indigenous peoples avoided between 42.8 and 59.7 million metric tons (mtc) of co2 emissions each year in these three countries; these combined emissions were the equivalent of taking between 9 and 12.6 million vehicles out of circulation for one year.  of the 404 million hectares occupied by indigenous peoples, governments have formally recognized their collective property or usage rights over about 269 million hectares. while the impact of guaranteeing tenure security is great, the cost is very low: only $6 dollars are needed to title a hectare of land in colombia, and $45 dollars in bolivia.  the fao/filac report says that the costs of securing indigenous lands are 5 to 42 times lower than the average costs of avoided co2 through fossil carbon capture and storage for both coal and gas fired power plants. indigenous and tribal peoples are invaluable agents against climate change  indigenous and tribal peoples are involved in the communal governance of between 320 and 380 million hectares of forests in the region, which store about 34,000 million metric tons of carbon, more than all the forests in indonesia or in the democratic republic of congo. while amazon basin indigenous territories lost less than 0.3 percent of the carbon in their forests between 2003 and 2016, non-indigenous protected areas lost 0.6percent and other areas that were neither indigenous territories nor protected areas lost 3.6 percent. as a result, even though indigenous territories cover 28percent of the amazon basin, they only generated 2.6 26 percent of the region's gross carbon emissions. the report's findings also indicate that indigenous peoples and tribal peoples play an important role in safeguarding biodiversity. these showed that brazil's indigenous territories have more species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians than in all the country's protected areas outside these territories, while in bolivia two-thirds of the country's vertebrate species and 60 percent of its plant species can be found in the tacana and leco de apolo indigenous territories.",2021-04-16
"20","Addressing COVID-19's impacts and structural crisis in the Pacific","http://www.fao.org/asiapacific/countries/en/","eriko hibi, fao sub-regional coordinator for the pacific and representative to thirteen pacific states discusses covid-19 pandemic's impact in the pacific, and plans to rebuild. first of all, what sets the pacific islands apart from the rest of the world? they are geographically isolated, have limited land mass and arable land, fragile natural environments, and fewer resources. and, increasingly, they are more vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change.  they rely heavily on food imports and a few economic sectors such as tourism, remittances, and revenue from fisheries licensing. also, you have to keep in mind that most things cost more here. energy, infrastructure, transportation, communication and servicing costs are high. this means reduced opportunities for private sector development, which is essential for stimulating domestic food production, and continued reliance on imports.   on top of this, investments in agriculture are low, unemployment rates high, particularly among youth, and labour skills insufficient. all this has an enormous impact on pacific communities. globally, the ten countries with the highest obesity rate are pacific islands. populations here suffer from the triple burden of malnutrition - a situation where undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and obesity co-exist. non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death and morbidity as islanders have mostly moved away from eating fresh seafood and traditional crops in favour of imported, processed foods high in energy, sugar, salt and fat.   and despite growing political commitments in the past decade, these challenges remain.   could you tell us how measures in response to covid-19 might have made these challenges worse or more evident? it is not just the measures put in place by the pacific islands, but the structural impact of the pandemic emanating from decisions and responses from other countries far away that is affecting the region's food security and nutrition. this is why i call this crisis a ""structural"" one.  to date, there are no confirmed covid-19 cases in the thirteen pacific countries where fao works except for a small number earlier in fiji. however, all islands issued a state of emergency and closed borders.    whether there are cases or not, however, the pandemic's impact here is immense. in many pacific small island developing states (sids), imported foods constitute half of a person's food intake. if the pandemic continues, and the global and local supply chain - from production, processing, export, transportation to import - is affected, it will disrupt the region's food systems. pacific sids rely on cargo shipment for food imports, and the shipping industry has been experiencing slowdowns due to port closures and logistics disruptions. the impact of this can be long lasting.  food prices have also been affected. whilst some islands such as fiji have a price control mechanism for foods considered essential - such as rice, vegetable oil, milk, salt, canned tuna, sugar - the prices of other, non-controlled foods, for example fruits and vegetables, have increased due to domestic supply chain disruptions. a few days after the lockdown in fiji's capital, suva, the costs of the most consumed vegetables increased between 11 to 36 percent, in some cases up to 75 percent. most rural populations produce and consume their own food. but as some of the fertilizers and livestock feed are imported, domestic production may be affected in the long run. also domestic travel restrictions, low demand for fresh produces from tourism and market restrictions are affecting smallholders as they can't sell their produces.     tourism is key to islands' economies. in cook islands, tourism represents 70 percent of the overall gdp and accounts for almost 35 percent of employment. tourism-dependent economies will face major economic losses this year and possibly next year.  in some sids, remittances contribute greatly to the national economy. for instance, in 2018, about 41 percent of tonga's gdp came from remittances. these enable receiving populations to meet basic needs, including food. in tuvalu, half of the remittances are spent on food. these remittances have been falling during the pandemic, weakening families' purchasing power, and possibly increasing demand for cheaper and unhealthier imported foods. revenues from the licensing of tuna fishing vessels have also fallen. measures including airport and port closures, and quarantining of crews have delayed operations, costing fishing companies $50,000 - $60,000 per day per vessel and island nations $130,000 per day per vessel in lost revenues.  pacific islands are often hit by cyclones. could you tell us about the impact of the latest one? cyclone harold struck vanuatu, fiji, solomon islands and tonga in early april, damaging homes, water supplies and crops. in vanuatu, the cyclone affected well over half of the population, causing significant damage to croplands and at the worst time possible - when the growing season has just started. it devastated avocado, mango and citrus trees, destroyed taro gardens, and smashed fishing boats. in fiji, the damage to fields and crops is estimated to be over $12 million.  as the cyclone hit during fears of covid-19 spreading, the flow of external food and other aid relief was seriously hampered. fao is providing seeds, fertilizers and tools to the heaviest-hit communities in vanuatu and fiji, and supporting farmers to prepare their land for planting. we expect, however, the combined effects of the cyclone and covid-19 to have a lasting negative impact on the region's food security, value chains and livelihoods. what has the region learnt from the pandemic? what has changed? never before has the importance of land and ocean resources been so evident as well as fao's and partners' ongoing work to protect and sustainably manage them more relevant. we are seeing more small-scale fishing activities by local communities, likely due to reduced access to imported foods, and atolls, in particular, have introduced plans to increase small-scale fishing.  it's also likely for communities living in urban and peri-urban areas to turn to growing food, for example, by setting up vegetable gardens where possible, and buy more local foods.   the need to keep diseases and pests at bay has also emerged more strongly during this period, with heightened interest across the region to stop the spread of the african swine fever, recently confirmed in papua new guinea. another realization has been the importance of quality and real-time data to respond to the structural effects of the pandemic. what will fao's role be in bringing about positive change post-covid-19? fao will continue supporting sids to strengthen their food systems and make it more nutrition-sensitive and disaster-resilient, be that through boosting local food production, or scaling up climate-smart activities, such as agroforestry, promoting climate-resilient, local plant species. other initiatives include: supporting coastal fisheries communities to better access high value fish and saving their lives at sea; training young farmers and linking them to markets; assisting livestock farms and biosecurity authorities to prevent animal diseases; collecting data relating to agriculture and food insecurity to help shape better policies; strengthening the capacity of national food safety authorities through labs and training; supporting fast food vendors to make their foods healthier; and creating consumer awareness - all of which would lead to improving access to healthier and more nutritious food. this is an opportunity to rebuild and improve food systems and livelihoods in a sustainable way. ultimately, fao and pacific sids share a common vision - that of access to safe, sufficient and nutritious foods for all.",2021-04-16

""the opportunity cheaper solar energy offers also increases the urgency of making sure appropriate water management and governance systems are in place,"" said eduardo mansur, director of fao's land and water division. ""we need to think strategically about how this technology can be used to encourage more sustainable use of groundwater resources to avoid risks such as wasteful water-use and over-abstraction of groundwater."" new possibilitiesglobally, about 20 percent of cultivated land is irrigated, and they contribute to about 40 percent of total food output.irrigation boosts agricultural productivity in various ways, including by allowing more and varied crops per year. sub-saharan africa and latin america have relatively low deployment of irrigation on croplands, indicating sizeable potential gains there.solar powered irrigations systems indicate the potential to reduce ghg emissions per unit of energy used for water pumping by more than 95 percent compared to alternatives fuelled by diesel or fossil-fuel driven electricity grids, according to fao's report. assessing the economic viability of a solar-powered irrigation system today requires consideration of a broad range of parameters, including the size and configuration of the system, water storage capacity and feasibility, the depth of the well, the remoteness of the area and the type of soil to be irrigated. the so-called ""payback periods"" for such investments depend on the above conditions, on crops and markets, and also on the presence of government price incentives. fao urges governments to review their incentive schemes to favor ""green subsidies"" over those for fossil fuels. water managementsolar irrigation pumps could also cause unsustainable groundwater extraction, as farmers may seek to expand planted areas or switch to more water-intensive crops. about 30 percent of aquifers in india, for example, are already considered at critical status. while tailored drip irrigation can lead to water savings, assuming it will automatically do so at the farm level is a fallacy, the report says. irrigation policy decisions should be taken after proper water accounting over larger territorial areas, as rainfall, surface water, groundwater, soil moisture and evaporation processes linked to different land uses are all part of the same hydrological cycle. modern solar-powered systems offer useful tools to improve water governance, with electronic controller devices able to provide real-time inputs regarding storage tank levels, pump speed and borehole water levels that could ultimately trigger regulatory decisions to pre-empt excessive use remotely. india and egypt are both experimenting with such an approach. a viable alternative is to set water charges in relation to supply and demand calculations determined with satellite and thermal imagery, a technique made easier even at the level of individual fields by the fao water productivity open-access portal (wapor).one of fao's cardinal recommendations for the greater use of solar-powered irrigation is to ensure that no water is withdrawn without an appropriate water management plan in place. there's work to do on that front. a survey of technical experts from 25 countries suggest that while three-fourths of nations have government programmes and policies to promote small-scale irrigation, fewer than half have specific regulations limiting groundwater abstraction for such purposes. solar panels produce energy even at times when no irrigation is needed, opening up significant opportunities to run rice huskers, mills, water purifiers and cold storage units, all contributing to rural development and incomes. in some cases, solar power can also become a ""remunerative crop"" if farmers are encouraged to reduce overpumping water by opting to pool and sell their surplus energy to the electricity grid.",2021-04-16
"22","Sources of GHG emissions by livestock","http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197608/icode/","the bulk of ghg emissions by livestock originate from four main categories of activities: enteric fermentation, manure management, feed production and energy consumption.methane (ch4) emissions from enteric fermentation. ruminant animals (cattle, buffalo, sheep and goat) produce methane as part of their digestive process. in their rumen (stomach), microbial fermentation breaks down carbohydrates into simple molecules that can be digested by the animals. methane is a by-product of this process. highly fibrous feed rations cause higher ch4 emissions per unit of energy ingested. non-ruminant species, such as pigs, do also produce methane but amounts are much lower by comparison (enteric fermentation from cattle, buffalo, small ruminants and pig, but not from poultry, is included in this assessment).methane (ch4) and nitrous oxide (n2o) emissions from manure management. manure contains two chemical components that can lead to greenhouse gas emissions during storage and processing: organic matter that can be converted in methane and nitrogen that leads to nitrous oxide emissions. methane is released from the anaerobic decomposition of organic material.this occurs mostly when manure is managed in liquid form, such as in deep lagoons or holding tanks. during storage and processing, nitrogen is mostly released in the atmosphere as ammonia (nh3) that can be later transformed into n2o (indirect emissions).carbon dioxide (co2) and nitrous oxide (n2o) emissions from feed production, processing and transport. carbon dioxide emissions originate from the expansion of feed crops and pasture into natural habitats, which causes the oxidation of c in soil and vegetation. they also originate from the use of fossil fuel to manufacture fertilizer, and process and transport feed. the emissions of n2o come from the use of fertilizers (organic or synthetic) for feed production and from the direct deposition of manure on pasture or during the management and application of manure on crop fields. direct or indirect n2o emissions can vary greatly according to temperature and humidity at the time of application and their quantification is thus subject to high uncertainty.carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from energy consumption. energy consumption occurs along the entire livestock supply chains producing co2 emissions. at feed production level, it mostly relates to the production of fertilizers and to the use of machinery for crop management, harvesting, processing and transportation. energy is also consumed on the animal production site, either directly through mechanized operations, or indirectly for the construction of buildings and of equipment. finally, processing and transportation of animal commodities involve further energy use.>> back to main article",2021-04-16

""having access to the right information at the right time and in the right form is no longer a luxury, but a necessity"", the director-general explained, citing a mobile phone as ""the most important agricultural tool today and in the future"". qu noted that numerous disruptions in food supply chains triggered by pandemic-related restrictions forced farmers to look for alternative ways to market and sell their produce directly to the consumers, therefore innovative approaches, such as e-commerce platforms, are of particular relevance today. in this context, the fao director-general urged the international community to take advantage of modern information and communication technologies and incorporate these innovations across food value chains and agri-food systems.  he also noted that in austria the digital portfolio and agriculture were managed by the same ministry, which provides considerable synergy potential for innovation and digital transformation in the agri-food sector. the director-general referred to fao's steady embracing of the digital world, by incorporating more and more innovative digital tools in its work. as examples, he cited the state-of-the-art tools that the hand-in-hand initiative builds on, namely the hand in hand geospatial platform, the data lab for statistical innovation and earth map, an innovative, free and open-source big data tool, developed by fao in collaboration with google.  qu stressed the importance of developing a digital strategy to ensure that all citizens receive adequate connectivity even in rural and remote areas, as well as education to operate digital tools. in this regard, he noted that fao's 1000 digital villages initiative aims to promote the digital transformation of villages and small towns across the world, and invited austria to join the initiative.  at the end of his keynote address, he stated that ""fao will continue to work hand-in-hand with all partners to scale-up innovation and disseminate promising technologies, for better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life"". the opening session of the conference also saw the participation of julia klöckner, germany's federal minister of food and agriculture, johannes hahn, eu commissioner for budget and administration and elisabeth köstinger, austria's minister for sustainability and tourism.",2021-04-16

enabling it to expand, provide more in-depth investment support to countries and strengthen its collaboration with international and national financial institutions and other development partners.as fao director-general qu dongyu said: ""together, we are transforming agriculture and agri-food systems through targeted investment, innovation, knowledge and strengthened capacities.""in 2020, working with partner international financial institutions and with our member country governments, we helped mobilize $6.6 billion of public investment projects to create stronger and more sustainable agri-food systems. that's an increase of $900 million (16%) compared to 2019 and an increase from 32 to 38 projects. in sub-saharan africa alone, last year we supported the design of $2 billion new public investments that will provide people with access to healthy food and create jobs.a good example is the joint programme to respond to the challenges of covid-19, conflict and climate change, benefitting six countries in the sahel by investing in agricultural infrastructure, innovative technology as well as human and social capital in cross border areas facing security issues. both fao and world food programme (wfp) will be supporting the g5 sahel secretariat and international fund for agricultural development (ifad) in project implementation. the cost of the project is $180 million over six years of which 109 million financed by ifad and $71 million by the green climate fund.also last year, we supported the implementation of projects worldwide in some 120 countries. this consists of providing critical technical support to governments during the projects' implementation period (typically around five years) to make sure that investments are on track to deliver the desired outcomes. the centre's multidisciplinary teams can address implementation issues related to all aspects of agriculture and rural development including infrastructure and irrigation, agriculture, livestock, fisheries, forestry, etc. the centre also provides support to better soft investments in human and social capital and capacities, governance and institutions, farmer organizations and community development.you mentioned covid-19. could you tell us about the centre's work in relation to this?countries have been looking to fao for policy guidance on responding to covid-19 and technical assistance to ongoing projects. in response, we provided timely policy advice, undertook rapid impact assessments of covid-19 on agri-food systems to inform countries' decisions and solutions to mitigating the negative effects of the pandemic on their food and agriculture sector.with investment partners such as the world bank - the centre's oldest and largest partner - we developed response packages and reoriented ongoing projects to address the covid-19 challenges.with the european bank for reconstruction and development (ebrd), we established a ($3 million) technical response facility to help the agri-food sector to overcome covid-19 challenges and to strengthen agri-food systems' longer-term resilience.with the european commission, we are undertaking rapid agri-food systems assessments in many countries - by end of 2021 we aim to reach 61 countries, among the most affected by food insecurity and malnutrition. the assessments are only the first step. the work will help to shape new policy recommendations in food and agriculture, and potential private and public investments in agri-food systems' transformations in those countries. we are also working with many partners, including european development finance institutions, to help de-risk investments in the agri-food sector - a sector marked by uncertainty and volatility even at the best of times.we are also integrating covid-19 response activities into the global agriculture and food security program (gafsp) projects in countries such as bangladesh, the central african republic, ethiopia, haiti, senegal and yemen.the centre has also stepped up its actions to increase visibility and influence public debate on the need for investment in agri-food systems as the world works towards building back better.we have a good track record of bringing stakeholders together from the public and private sectors, including farmers and their organizations, to discuss policy issues and resolve bottlenecks.in parallel, the centre has been key to the rolling out of the poverty-focused hand-in-hand initiative in close to 40 countries.(note: more info on the centre and its work on covid-19 here).apart from supporting the covid-19 response, could you give some other examples of the centre's work and key achievements in 2020?good investment design is fundamental, but you also need effective implementation to make a positive impact in people's lives. our investment team plays a substantial role in supporting the successful roll-out of publicly funded investment projects - irrespective of whether we were involved in their design or not. this can range from supporting the modernization of digital land registries in europe and central asia, long-term support to pastoralists in the sahel, water management in the caribbean or rural entrepreneurs and trade in the pacific. the centre casts a wide footprint when it comes to delivering impact at country level.we also forged new partnerships with financing institutions to expand our investment support, and new collaborations are being built with the european investment bank, the asian infrastructure investment bank and others.mindful that public money alone is not enough to end poverty, we are creating new and innovative partnerships to transform how development is financed, especially through blended finance  - the use of public or philanthropic money combined with private investment into businesses that generate social and environmental impacts alongside financial returns.for example, we are working with the european commission, through the agrintel initiative, providing advisory services to impact funds and blended finance operations investing in small and medium agribusinesses through equity and loans. blended finance is certainly an area to watch.since we began, our team has supported the eu to review over 124 blended finance proposals worth eur 609 million. funding has already been cleared for 23 proposals worth eur 96 million.in collaboration with the eu delegation in uganda, the centre is strengthening the national uganda development bank (udb) to finance responsible private investments in food and agriculture.blending fao's knowledge and expertise with finance and working with national and international financial institutions will help our member countries achieve the impact at the scale required to achieve the sdgs.the centre is also teaming up with research centres to advance knowledge in digital agriculture, human capital, and foster opportunities for rural youth and women across the food value chain.another key area is green and climate financing, helping countries better tap into this type of financing. both directly as fao and with financing partners, we unlocked around $675 million of green financing with the green climate fund between 2018-20.what's ahead for the centre? what are some of the main priorities over the next years?we will continue to work with international financial institutions and banks on ways to strengthen the resilience of the agri-food systems. this means helping public and private actors to transition to greener and better production systems that offer better nutrition without harming the environment, and ultimately leading to a better life for all.we will also continue to enable and promote the use of new data sources and climate-sensitive technologies (like geospatial data, digital applications and drones) to create better investment planning, risk management and lower interest rates for farmers.we look forward to supporting national banks in more countries to enable them to finance more and better farmer and private investments in sustainable food and agriculture.what are the key ingredients for creating sustainable growth?i would sum it up as: a clear long-term strategy, improved policy environment and critical public investment to accelerate the adoption of innovation including digital and green technologies and practices, alongside basic infrastructure. public investment is critical to catalyze private investment, particularly in finance. meeting the sdgs - from ending poverty and hunger to building a more equitable, healthier and greener world - calls for more blended financing.increasing efficiencies in the food system must also go hand-in-hand with reducing inequalities, creating decent jobs and livelihoods for women and youth especially. in this respect, public investment in human capital of the men and women who produce, process and trade food (especially small-scale farmers) is essential as an enabler for all the rest: growth, sustainability, equality and inclusiveness.there is a need for urgent action to transform agri-food systems. the resources - intellectual, financial and material - are there, but we must be better organized and coordinated so that the world's efforts are not too late and ineffective for too many people.",2021-04-16

""fao is committed to ensuring free access to current, reliable and trusted data, as they provide the indispensable evidence base that countries require to formulate policy decisions and monitor progress towards agreed objectives.""the yearbook is divided into four thematic chapters focusing respectively on the economic dimensions of agriculture, forestry and fishing; production, trade and price trends; food security and nutrition; environmental sustainability. the yearbook is accompanied by fao's statistical pocketbook, which provides a quick and easy reference on the main facts and trends of food and agriculture.key takeawaysagriculture's global contribution to global gross domestic product increased by 68 percent between 2000 and 2018 to $3.4 trillion. asia accounts for 63 percent of that total, while africa is home to the fastest growth, almost twice the global pace. the number of people employed in agriculture has declined in this millennium, to 884 million or 27 percent of the global work force compared to 1 050 million or 40 percent in 2000. the bulk of that decline occurred in asia, although the sharpest drop was observed in europe, where only 5.3 percent of the employed population works in the sector, compared to 49 percent in africa. the yearbook also notes that 37.1 percent of these workers are women, who account for more than half the national agricultural work force in 22 countries.global pesticide use has increased by one-third to 4.1 million tonnes each year, although has been steady since 2012. china is the world's top user, deploying more than four times as much as brazil and the united states of america. worldwide fertilizer use has expanded to 53 million tonnes - about 121 kilograms per hectare of cropland - with nitrogen the dominant chemical and potassium accounting for the fastest growth rate. the fastest expansions have been in africa and the americas, although the former starts from a very low starting level. the production of primary crops was 9.2 billion tonnes in 2018, around 50 percent more than in 2000. oil crops had the fastest growth, up 88 percent. four crops account for half of global primary crop production: sugar cane, maize, wheat and rice.the data also show that the top producer of many of the chief food commodity crops accounts for a sizeable share of global output: brazil for sugar cane, china for rice and potatoes, the u.s. for maize and soybeans. a similar story describes processed outputs, with china the leading soybean oil producer, indonesia and malaysia far and away the main palm oil producers, and ukraine and russia the main sunflower oil producers. global food trade has grown even faster than output, with its total monetary value almost quadrupled to $1.4 trillion between 2000 and 2018.hunger is on the rise, with almost 690 million people undernourished in 2019, close to 60 million more than in 2014. at the same time, obesity is also increasing: it affected 13.1 percent of the adult population in 2016, compared with 8.7 percent in 2000.cropland increased by 75 million hectares between 2000 and 2017, equivalent to twice the size of japan. over the same period, forest land decreased by 89 million hectares, equivalent to size of nigeria.world agriculture emissions within the farm gate grew by 16 percent between 2000 and 2017. about 60 percent come from livestock-related activities.the yearbook offers granular data organized by country and subject, as well as a wealth of graphics and maps that make the data accessible.",2021-04-16
"27","FAO and JR Farms join forces to support youth-led initiatives in agribusiness in Rwanda","https://jrfarmsafrica.com/","12 march 2021, kigali/rome - the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) in rwanda has signed an agreement with jr farms limited to promote youth involvement in agriculture and create decent work opportunities.   jr farms is a rwandan led agri-enterprise operating  in rwanda, nigeria and zambia in the areas of food processing and retailing, agro commodity trading and consulting. its corporate goals are to ensure food security, end hunger in africa and create decent jobs for africa's women and young people.  fao and jr farms have joined forces with the aim of developing youth-led agriculture enterprises by providing equity funds, through jr farms' green agribusiness fund (gaf), to selected youth-led agribusinesses involved in different agri-food value chains. the young ""agri-preneurs"" will also benefit from training and capacity development opportunities and will be introduced to wider networks of fellow agri-preneurs.   ""this important partnership with jr farms will open up new opportunities for young people in agriculture and agribusiness to create decent work, improve livelihoods and boost food security,"" fao representative in rwanda gualbert gbehounou said.

""we need to rely on markets as an integral part of the global food system. this is all the more important in the face of major disruptions, whether they come from covid-19, locust outbreaks or climate change,"" wrote fao director-general qu dongyu in his introduction to the report.   the rise of global agri-food value chains the report estimates that about one-third of global agricultural and food exports are traded within a global value chain and cross borders at least twice. the rise of global value chains is driven by income growth, lower trade barriers and technological advancements, which have transformed markets and trade processes, linking farmers to traders and consumers across regions and countries. ""global value chains can make it easier for developing countries to integrate into global markets. as they link our food markets closely, they also provide a mechanism to diffuse best practices to promote sustainable development,"" said the fao director-general. in turn, by participating in global value chains, smallholder farmers can boost their food production and income. on average and in the short term, a 10 percent increase in agriculture's global value chain participation can result in an increase of around 1.2 percent in labour productivity, finds the report.  smallholder farmers, however, are often missing out on the benefits of global value chains. furthermore, the emergence of global value chains with the stringent food quality and safety requirements could further marginalize smallholders. ""we need to redouble efforts to include smallholder farmers in modern food value chains, thus securing rural incomes and food security in both rural and urban areas,"" said qu. to achieve this, there is a need for broad policies to create an environment that enables markets to flourish and bolsters smallholders' participation in global value chains - for example, better rural infrastructure and services, education and productive technology.  digital technologies can help markets to function better and can improve farmers' access to them. innovations, such as food e-commerce, can benefit both farmers and consumers. however, to guarantee that the dividends of digital innovation are shared with the poorest, the current digital divide in agriculture needs to be reduced. the adoption of more inclusive business models, such as contract farming and blockchains, can also help farmers to better integrate into modern and more complex value chains.  for example, participation in contract farming can increase farm income by more than half - based on an analysis of main studies on contract farming. the report underlines, however, the overall lack of information on the different impacts of contract farming, apart from its impact on farmers' welfare. how can agricultural and food markets foster sustainable development? the report makes the case for the role agri-food markets can play in fostering sustainable development. it argues that the promotion and wider application of voluntary sustainability certification schemes and standards in agriculture, for example, can address trade-offs between economic, environmental and social objectives. sustainability certification schemes can promote fair trade, inclusion, non-discrimination, and environmentally-friendly farm practices. they also can ensure occupational safety, ban child labour, and encourage investments. for instance, according to data from smallholder coffee farmers in uganda, sustainability-certified families spend 146 percent more on child education and keep children at school longer than non-certified families. another study on certification schemes that promote sustainable forests show that the production of forest shade-grown coffee in ethiopia can help alleviate forest degradation. the report also points out that whilst bananas are one of the most traded tropical commodities in the world, only an estimated 5-8 percent are covered under sustainability standards. the evolution of trade and markets - trends and drivers international agri-food trade has been driven by: technological progress; urbanization; population and income growths; lower transport costs; trade policies and a decline in average import tariffs.  upper and lower middle-income countries together have increased their share in global agri-food exports from about 25 percent in 2001 to 36 percent in 2018.  whilst global agri-food trade has doubled since 1995 in real value, its growth rate has been slower since the 2008 financial crisis. this is expected to be further impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. the 2008 financial crisis and consequent economic slowdown stalled the evolution of agri-food global value chains, and the covid-19 pandemic could further disrupt their potential in global trade and growth.  digital technologies are transforming all stages of the food value chain - from farm to table. they improve efficiency, create jobs and save resources. but it is difficult to foresee all the impacts technological innovation can have on how we grow, process, trade and consume food.  while countries in europe and central asia, and east asia and the pacific tend to trade within the same regions, countries in south asia, latin america and the caribbean, sub-saharan africa, north america, and the middle east and north africa trade more globally. about 90percent of exports in agricultural commodities from sub-saharan africa, and latin america and the caribbean are destined for other regions. trade will continue to play an important role in global food security and nutrition, by moving food from surplus to deficit regions.  regional trade agreements can stimulate global value chain participation and spur institutional and policy reform. however, as many vulnerable countries continue to rely on global markets, the promotion of the multilateral trading system is important. the larger part of agri-food trade is made up of processed food products.about soco 2020 the report covers four areas: trends in agricultural and food markets; global value chains in food and agriculture; farmers and value chains - business models more sustainable growth; digital technologies and agricultural and food markets.the soco 2020 report was launched at a virtual event today with the participation of director-general qu dongyu; the united states secretary of agriculture, sonny perdue; the minister for agriculture, land reform and rural development of south africa, thoko didiza; the parliamentary state secretary of germany<U+0092>s ministry for food and agriculture, hans-joachim fuchtel; the chairperson of the fao committee on commodity problems, gustaf daud sirait; the deputy director-general of the world trade organization, alan wolff; and the undersecretary for agriculture and rural development of mexico, miguel garcia winder.speakers highlighted how the covid-19 pandemic has shown the importance of ensuring the flow of food supply chains at global, regional and local levels. they agreed that food trade is a critical tool for development and economic growth, and that innovation and digitalization offer new opportunities to increase market activity and facilitate integration of smallholder farmers into modern and more complex value chains.the meeting was also attended by representatives from canada, sri lanka, the european commission and the university of bocconi (italy). the video of the high-level event can be accessed here.",2021-04-16

""forests play a fundamental role in combating rural poverty, ensuring food security and providing people with livelihoods. and they deliver vital environmental services such as clean air and water, the conservation of biodiversity and combating climate change,"" said fao director-general josé graziano da silva, launching the report in durban. he noted an ""encouraging tendency towards a reduction in rates of deforestation and carbon emissions from forests,"" as well as improved information that can inform good policy, noting that presently national forest inventories cover 81 percent of global forest area, a substantial increase over the past 10 years. ""the direction of change is positive, but we need to do better,"" the fao director-general cautioned. ""we will not succeed in reducing the impact of climate change and promoting sustainable development if we do not preserve our forests and sustainably use the many resources they offer us,"" he added. main findings while in 1990 forests made up 31.6 percent of the word's land areas, or some 4 128 million hectares, this has changed to 30.6 percent in 2015, or some 3 999 million hectares, according to fra. meanwhile, the net annual rate of forest loss has slowed from 0.18 percent in the early 1990s to 0.08 percent during the period 2010-2015. today, the bulk (93 percent) of the world's forest area is natural forest - a category that includes primary forest areas where human disturbances have been minimized, as well as secondary forest areas that have regenerated naturally.  planted forest, another subcategory, currently accounts for 7 percent of the world's overall forest area, having increased by over 110 million hectares since 1990. fao's report stresses the critical importance of forests to people, the environment, and the global economy. the forest sector contributes about $600 billion annually to global gdp and provides employment to over 50 million people. biggest losses in africa and south america africa and south america had the highest net annual loss of forests in 2010-2015, with 2.8 and 2 million hectares respectively, but the report notes how the rate of loss has ""substantially decreased"" from the previous five year period. since 1990 most deforestation has taken place in the tropics. in contrast, net forest area has increased in temperate countries while there has been relatively little change in the boreal and subtropical regions. however, given global population growth, average per capita forest area has predominantly declined per person in the tropics and subtropics, but also in all the other climatic regions with the exception of the temperate. better-managed forests globally, natural forest area is decreasing and planted forest area is increasing and while most forests remain publicly owned, ownership by individuals and communities has increased. in all cases fao stresses the importance of sustainable forest management practices. natural forests, the least touched by humankind, contribute to conserving genotypes - the genetic constitutions of organisms - and in maintaining the composition of natural tree species while providing vital habitats to endangered animal species.  forests help replenish groundwater supplies crucial for drinking, agriculture and other uses. they also protect soils from erosion, avalanches and landslides.  planted forests, for their part, are often established for production and where well-managed can provide various forest goods and service and help reduce the pressure on natural forests. this must also be seen in the context of the increase in global wood consumption and the continued widespread reliance on woodfuel. ""the management of forests has improved dramatically over the last 25 years. this includes planning, knowledge sharing, legislation, policies - a whole range of important steps that countries have implemented or are implementing,"" said kenneth macdicken, leader of fao's global forest resources assessment team. he underscored how since 1990 the designation of additional forest land for conservation increased by some 150 million ha and that forest in protected areas has increased by over 200 million hectares. safeguarding biodiversity forests are rich in biological diversity, and home to more than half of the terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. fao warns that despite conservation efforts the threat of biodiversity loss persists and is likely to continue with deforestation, forest degradation - a reduction in tree biomass density from human or natural causes such as logging, fire, windthrows and other events - pollution and climate change all having negative impacts. currently, forest area primarily designated for biodiversity conservation accounts for 13 percent of the world's forest, or 524 million hectares, with the largest areas reported in brazil and the united states.  over the last five year period africa reported the highest annual increase in the area of forest for conservation while europe, north and central american and north america reported the lowest compared to previous reporting periods, while the increase reported by asia for 2010-2015 was lower than that reported for 2000-1010 but higher than the increase reported in the 1990s. addressing climate change deforestation and forest degradation increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but forest and tree growth absorbs carbon dioxide which is the main greenhouse gas. fao notes how a more sustainable management of forests will result in a reduction in carbon emissions from forests and has a vital role to play in addressing the impacts of climate change. fao has estimated that total carbon emissions from forests decreased by more than 25 percent between 2001 and 2015, mainly due to a slowdown in global deforestation rates.",2021-04-16

""we cannot wait until we finish dealing with the health impacts before we turn to food security. if we don't start implementing livelihoods assistance now, we will face multiple food crises. and a bill many times greater,"" warned fao director-general qu dongyu at a briefing today on the un agency's revised humanitarian response to covid-19.   ""it's becoming increasingly clear that the pandemic's impacts go far beyond health,"" said ramesh rajasingham, acting assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator. ""acting early can prevent increasing vulnerabilities but also be a much more cost effective way of addressing this crisis. the role of emergency livelihoods interventions to save lives and livelihoods, and pull back people from the verge of famine is critical. agriculture-based livelihoods are critical in most countries we work in as they are the main source of income for the majority of vulnerable populations. and this relies on seasons that cannot be missed or skipped,"" added rajasingham. ""more and more global leaders are stressing that the pandemic could cost more lives in hunger than in those actually infected by the virus. the worst-case scenario is not a foregone conclusion, but we have to act fast - and at scale,"" said dominique burgeon, fao's director of emergencies. new funding request to respond to growing needs fao's new funding request of $350 million is about three times more than in late march as covid-19's staggering socioeconomic impacts become more evident. fao's humanitarian response to covid-19 is part of the global covid-19 humanitarian response plan. additional funding is urgently required to address new needs emerging from covid-19. new activities will build upon critical livelihood-saving support currently being delivered, including:   in south sudan, fao carried out its largest seed distribution so that farmers do not miss the main planting season. to date, fao has distributed over 4 million kilograms of the procured and pre-positioned 8 million kilograms of crop and vegetable seeds, and over 100 000 agricultural hand tools to about 1.8 million people. this means that each family can grow enough food for at least 6 months and sell some surplus. in addition, nearly 50 000 people received fishing kits. in somalia, fao fully transitioned its cash assistance to mobile cash delivery, and, over the last 60 days, transferred over 4 million dollars in mobile money to help 200 000 somalis access food and other basic needs. fao has registered more than 2.1 million people on its mobile money platform. in addition, 240 000 somalis are receiving e-vouchers via sms to get seeds, farm tools, irrigation service and storage bags from local traders. this way, fao reinjects money into the local economy and avoids supply chain delays due to covid-19.  in syria, fao supported vegetable producers to set up nurseries, which are estimated to bring farmers an additional income of almost $2 000 per year.  in pakistan, fao carried out an online campaign, engaging 160 000 people to learn about preventing food waste; and raised awareness, including through its farmer field schools, on how to stay safe of covid-19 transmission.  in haiti, fao distributed seeds and other inputs to nearly 50 000 people ahead of the main agricultural campaign.overall, fao's humanitarian response to covid-19 impacts will focus on: improving hunger data collection and analysis so that organisations can respond more effectively; maintaining food production, including through scaling up activities so that farmers can take advantage of coming plating seasons; ramping up support to post-production activities, like harvesting, storage, small-scale food processing and conservation, and linking producers to markets to ensure food supply chains stay functional; and, awareness raising so that people keeping food supply chains alive are not at risk of covid-19 transmission. facts and figures on hunger and pandemic's impact on food security[1]:  there is a growing risk of famine in some countries, potentially even several famines occurring at the same time. even before the pandemic, some 135 million were experiencing crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity, out of which 27 million people in ""emergency"" levels of acute food insecurity - on the brink of famine.  somalia is currently experiencing multiple shocks, including desert locust, flooding and covid-19. the fao-managed food security and nutrition analysis unit (fsnau) warned in may that the number of people facing ""crisis"" or worse levels of acute food insecurity is expected to increase to 3.5 million between july and september - triple compared to numbers in early 2020, over 100 percent greater than hunger figures in an average year, and worse than in 2017, when there was a high risk of famine.  in afghanistan, more than one in three afghans - some 10.3 million people- are projected to be acutely food insecure between june and november. in bangladesh, breakdowns in transportation systems are leading to the dumping of perishable food products and dramatic price reductions at the farm-gate, affecting producers' food security. in southeast asia, covid-19 is overlapping with a subregional drought. in syria, since mid-march, there have been price increases of 40-50 per cent in staple foods.  for many high-risk countries in latin america and the caribbean, the period between april and june coincides with the planting season for main crops. net food importing countries (e.g. caribbean countries, ecuador, venezuela) are particularly vulnerable due to currency devaluation and trade constraints. in east africa and the near east, where 42 million people are facing acute food insecurity, curving the desert locust outbreak is critical to safeguarding livelihoods and food security.while there is a high potential for a significant rise in acute food insecurity at crisis level and above in the coming months, this is not inevitable. ""if we support livelihoods now we can help to reduce needs and avoid growing hunger. and protect the most vulnerable from the collateral effects of the pandemic,"" said qu. ""donors were generous and fast in responding to the desert locust upsurge during the past months. we need this continued generosity and advocacy to prevent a steep rise in acute hunger. thank you for your action now,"" added the fao-director-general.

""we know that agricultural yields would rise by almost a third if women had the same access to resources as men. as a result, there would be up to 150 million fewer hungry people in the world. and we know that children have significantly better prospects for the future when their mothers are healthy, wealthy and educated. especially during the first 1,000 days of a child's life,"" he said. ""if we are serious about putting an end to poverty and hunger once and for all, then we all need to step up our support for rural women. as an investment in families, in our communities, in our wider societies, and in our planet's future,"" the eu commissioner argued. closing the gender gap in her remarks, slovak minister of agriculture and rural development and current president of the council of the european union, gabriela matecná, said that ""the gender gap imposes significant costs on society, in terms of lost agricultural output, food security and economic growth."" although nearly half the world's agricultural labour force is female, she noted, women own less than 20 percent of agricultural land. at the same time, 60 percent of chronically hungry people on the planet are women or girls. however ""when women are fully involved, the benefits can be seen immediately: families are healthier and better fed; their income, savings and investment go up. and what is true of families is also true of communities and, in the long run, of whole countries,"" matecná said. working together toward a common goal representatives of un organizations also participated in today's event, stressing the importance of stamping out gender inequality and empowering women with information, training, tenure, and fair access to resources and to agricultural, nutrition, and health support services. ""when you invest in a man, you invest in an individual. when you invest in a woman, you invest in a community,"" noted ifad president kanayo f. nwanze. ""we see time and time again that gender equality opens doors for entire communities to strengthen their food and nutrition security and to improve their social and economic well-being,"" he said, adding: ""empowering rural women is indeed empowering humanity."" ""it is only through empowering women farmers that we can unlock the power of global food systems. supporting them is essential in creating resilience, building stronger businesses, and advancing food security in the long term,"" denise brown, director of emergencies at wfp, told participants. maria noel vaeza, director of programs at un women, said: ""closing the gender gaps in agriculture can provide multiple development dividends, including gender equality for rural women, food security and poverty reduction, improved climate management and peaceful societies.""  key facts in developing countries, women make up 45% of the agricultural labour force, ranging from 20% in latin america to up to 60% in parts of africa and asia.in developing countries in africa and asia and the pacific, women typically work 12-13 hours more than men per week.across all regions women are less likely than men to own or control land, and their plots often are of poorer quality. less than 20% of the world's landholders are women.if women farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of hungry people in the world could be reduced by up to 150 million due to productivity gains.women reinvest up to 90% of their earnings back into their households - that's money spent on nutrition, food, healthcare, school, and income-generating activities - helping to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty.",2021-04-16

""as we are marking fao's 75th anniversary this week, more than ever, we need to continue the partnership the rbas have forged and renew our energy to fight hunger and build a better world,"" qu said, noting that ""the challenge to leave no-one behind and no land behind can only be addressed through collective action and partnership."" wfp executive director beasley described the nobel peace prize as ""a call to action"" to make the world aware of what the un agencies are confronting. he noted that the award had alerted the international community to the link between conflict and food insecurity and emphasised the significance of next year's food systems summit in effecting change. ""let it inspire us, encourage us, to do more and never give up,"" he said. the sentiment of pride and joy for wfp's award was shared by all participants, including ifad's president; the independent chairperson of fao's council, khalid mehboob (chair of the meeting); the president of the executive board of wfp and permanent representative of germany, ulrich seidenberger; the special envoy for the 2021 food systems summit, agnes kalibata; permanent representatives of members; as well as the un deputy secretary-general, amina mohammed, who addressed the meeting through a video message. rba collaboration in the field the meeting discussed the status of joint rba action plans and programmes at regional and country level. the fao director-general indicated that rba collaboration had increased since the last informal joint meeting of the three boards in september 2019. ""our most effective collaboration is happening at the country level: the number of joint rba programmes has almost doubled since 2017 reaching more than 50 countries today,"" qu said. ""that is what our members expect from us: to move forward in concrete ways."" turning his attention to specific programmes, the director-general detailed the rome-based agencies' action to expand efforts in the sahel region through a $180 million programme that is being developed, which is aimed at strengthening the resilience of populations vulnerable to covid-19, conflicts and climate change.   he then alluded to the canada-funded rba resilience initiative in the democratic republic of the congo, the niger, and somalia where the three agencies are collaborating to strengthen food security resilience and nutrition using an innovative approach that bridges humanitarian and development issues, with a particular focus on gender specific needs. the importance of working together was expressed by several speakers throughout the event. ifad president houngbo stressed the need to step up collaboration not only between the rome-based agencies but with other un agencies and institutions, depending on specific issues. the president of the executive board of wfp, ulrich seidenberger, noted that the world was facing an historical time of crisis and appreciated a greater focus at the rba agencies' meeting on concrete and operational issues. he indicated that it was important to ""break down silos"" to strengthen the agencies' collective commitment and implement joint programmes. members from all regions welcomed progress so far, highlighted the importance of continuing to increase synergies and noted that the three agencies are currently discussing their strategic planning, which offers more possibilities for further collaboration. rba covid-19 response the director-general noted that the covid-19 global pandemic was a ""turning point"" for the transformation of agri-food systems. he emphasized that fao had developed a comprehensive response and recovery programme with a strong focus on investment, innovation and data sharing to scale up action to achieve the sustainable development goals (sdgs). fao deputy director-general, beth bechdol, presented the joint response of the rbas to address the challenges posed by covid-19 on food security and nutrition, which cuts across four main areas: country programming and planning; policy and analytical support; advocacy and information sharing; and business continuity. bechdol said joint research was being conducted on the impact of covid-19 in 30 high-priority countries. individual assessments in the area of policy and support were conducted in a number of countries including fiji, haiti and tunisia, she noted. un food systems summit 2021 in a video address, the un deputy secretary-general amina mohammed, who is also chairperson of the advisory committee of the 2021 food systems summit, informed the meeting that the summit will take place in september 2021 during the un general assembly, while a pre-summit will be organized a few months earlier in rome to prepare for the main event in september. she described it as ""a people's summit, inclusive and focused on solutions and action."" the un special envoy for the 2021 food systems summit, agnes kalibata, referred to the summit as an opportunity to redefine food systems, stressing it was important to engage with communities and countries at a local level. the rbas provided an update on contributions to the summit as kalibata urged greater dialogue around the summit's five action tracks: (1) ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all, (2) shifting to sustainable consumption patterns, (3) boosting nature-positive production at scale, (4) advancing equitable livelihoods and (5) building resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stresses.",2021-04-16

with a 30-70 percent fatality rate - but it does not infect people. that said, ppr has major effects on people due to the severe impact of ppr on food security, community resilience and livelihoods.just over 1,200 global ppr outbreaks were recorded in 2019 (latest data available) compared to more than 3,500 in 2015 according to new data from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) and partners.the decrease in ppr outbreaks is attributed to the impact of vaccination campaigns in more than 50 countries. the campaigns were led and funded by countries with support from fao and partners. in just 12 of these countries, over 300 million goats and sheep were vaccinated between 2015 and 2018.two regions have been the worst hit by ppr, and reported the majority of outbreaks between 2015-2019 - asia over 75 percent and africa over 24 percent, although the disease may also be underreported. nearly half of all outbreaks in this period occurred in only five countries, highlighting the urgent need for strengthening prevention and control mechanisms.ppr has spread at an alarming rate over the last 15 years; more than 70 countries - mostly in asia, africa and middle east - have reported the disease since it was first identified in côte d'ivoire in the 1940s. at its worst, the disease threatens to infect up to 80 percent of the world's 2.5 billion small ruminants if not controlled, putting enormous pressure on some of the world's most vulnerable people.about 300 million families rely on small ruminants, such as sheep and goats, as a source of food and income, and are at risk of losing their livelihoods if the disease is not kept at bay. it is also estimated that ppr causes economic losses up to $2.1 billion per year.although it was first considered as a rinderpest-like disease of small domestic ruminants, in the recent past, ppr has also infected camels, cattle, water buffalo and a range of wildlife species - from the african buffalo to the saiga antelope in asia.the road to eradicating pprin 2015, the international community set the goal of eradicating ppr by 2030, and, since then, fao and the world organisation for animal health (oie) have developed and implemented a global ppr control and eradication strategy.""eradicating the disease is possible and essential to ending poverty and hunger. not only would it save a valuable source of food and income for many vulnerable people but could also prevent entire families from migrating - a risk they face when their livelihoods are destroyed. a world free of ppr will also mean more security and empowerment for rural women as they are often responsible for looking after livestock,"" said maria helena semedo, fao deputy director-general.as of may 2020 (latest data available), 58 countries and one region in namibia have been recognized as free of ppr - with russia and lesotho the latest countries added to the list last year. in addition, 21 countries, which have had no new cases for five consecutive years, can prepare their documentation for validation by oie for a ppr-free status. to reach ppr-free status, countries go through a thorough four-stage process (assessment, control, eradication, and post-eradication) supported by fao and oie.vaccination is essential for ppr prevention and control based on experience from the successful global eradication of rinderpest in 2011 by fao, oie and their partners, and the availability of effective ppr vaccines.fao and oie recommend that ppr vaccination should be rolled out during two successive years, followed by vaccination of newborn animals during one or two successive years.main obstacles in the fight against ppr""whilst ppr outbreaks have decreased significantly in recent years, the infection scope of the ppr virus, both geographical and host range, is still wide, and more needs to be done to fight the disease,"" said fao's ppr programme coordinator and veterinarian felix njeumi.shortage of vaccines, livestock movement, and mostly logistical challenges in carrying out vaccinations continue to remain the main obstacles for ppr prevention and control. the cost of one vaccine dose represents around one-eight of the cost of vaccine delivery.while thermotolerant technology is available, none of the existing vaccines are thermotolerant, and most ppr endemic countries are in tropical or subtropical regions with limited cold-chain resources for vaccine storage and transport. current existing vaccines also do not differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals.  ""we recognize that vaccination against ppr is central to the eradication of the disease and to protect animal health and welfare, as well livelihoods. the ppr vaccine bank provides farmers with timely and affordable access to high-quality vaccines enabling countries and regions to declare themselves free of ppr,"" said jean-philippe dop, the oie deputy director general of institutional affairs and regional activities.the ppr vaccine stock/bank established by fao, oie, and other partners have improved the quality assurance and supply of vaccines. however, to achieve ppr eradication, the funding gap for vaccination campaigns and other program activities must be filled.the first phase of the global ppr programme set a target of vaccinating 1.5 billion small ruminants by the end of 2021. as of mid-2020, around half of this target had been achieved, with the covid-19 pandemic having significantly disrupted animal health services, including ppr vaccinations and outbreak reporting, last year. these disruptions continue in 2021 as the world is still grappling with the pandemic. fao also stresses the need for prevention and control measures to be coordinated between neighboring countries to restrict transboundary movement of disease. strengthening surveillance and post-vaccination sero-monitoring at country level is also essential.the funding gap for the ppr global eradication program is estimated at $340 million. challenges, both financial and logistical, remain. however, the latest data show progress, reflecting the commitment of countries and fao, oie to eradicate ppr, and give cause for optimism. the second phase (2022-2027) of the programme will be formulated in 2021.",2021-04-16

""in front of the pandemic we need to redouble our efforts and reinforce our traditional commitment to help the most vulnerable,"" he said, adding that italy will promote the cause when it presides over the g20 next year. the food coalition is an opportunity to show solidarity and make innovative solutions accessible and affordable to all, said schouten, noting her government applauds italy for the initiative and has supported it from inception. ""knowledge is one of the few things that multiplies when you share it.""the covid-19 pandemic has made fao the leading organization of efforts to end hunger, much as it was established to do after the scourge of world war, said karman. ""humanity today has sufficient capacity to put an end to this humanitarian crisis,"" she said. interest in the food coalition is notable among members of the g-20, indicating a potential resource and advocacy base, in terms of expertise, policy commitment and funding mobilization. ministers from, costa rica, israel, italy and nigeria, participated in the panel discussions during the launch, as well as ambassadors from china, russian federation and the united states of america.how it workscovid-19 may add up to 132 million more people to the ranks of the world's undernourished this year, on top of the 690 million hungry people in 2019 - highlighting the challenge that the pandemic poses to the eradication of hunger by 2030. moreover, the current health crisis will have long-term effects on food security, affecting production, farmers' health and access to markets, rural jobs and livelihoods, triggering decreasing food supply and demand in rural and urban areas alike with adverse nutritional results, said the fao director-general. ""across the world, countries have to make sure that food value chains continue to function well ... and that the agricultural labour force and poor consumers, both rural and urban, are not pushed beyond the poverty line,"" he said.against this background, the food coalition aims to work for a unified global action in response to covid-19 and the risks to agri-food systems it poses. the alliance involves a devoted trust fund and a web-based hub allowing participants to access a basket of project-focused information and data, as well as the funding and types of assistance needed for many on-the-ground projects. fao has elaborated action sheets to provide specific details and these will continually be updated. areas of focus range from integrated social protection policies in latin america, supporting agricultural migrant workers in central asia and eastern europe and boosting capacities to contrast antimicrobial resistance in africa to accelerating the use of geospatial data by fao's new data hub. ""covid-19 has taught us that we need to increase the resilience of agri-food systems, both to be ready to minimize risks and to be able to cope with risks when they occur,"" said fao chief economist maximo torero. ""the food coalition helps us on this."" in july, fao released a covid-19 response and recovery programme that is designed around seven priority areas of work to help countries deal with immediate crises triggered by the pandemic and also to prepare for recovery and building back better agri-food systems. the food coalition will leverage high-level political, financial and technical support to enable timely and robust actions that meet country-level needs and demands identified through the programme. ""fao has a unique structure and capacity to bring this global alliance together,"" said fao deputy director-general beth bechdol. she noted fao can foster constructive dialogue among its 194 members, has strong linkages to many other important partners and has an expansive country network that can assure strong targeting and the proper prioritization of countries' own views. yunus, the nobel laureate, emphasized that ""rural economies must be rebuild as independent economies.""",2021-04-16

""these new, aggressive rust races have emerged at the same time that we're working with international partners to help countries combat the existing ones, so we have to be swift and thorough in the way we approach this,"" said fao plant pathologist fazil dusunceli. ""it's more important than ever that specialists from international institutions and wheat producing countries work together to stop these diseases in their tracks -  that involves continuous surveillance, sharing data and building emergency response plans to protect their farmers and those in neighboring countries."" wheat rusts spread rapidly over long distances by wind. if not detected and treated on time, they can turn a healthy looking crop, only weeks away from harvest, into a tangle of yellow leaves, black stems and shriveled grains.  fungicides can help to limit damage, but early detection and rapid action are crucial. so are integrated management strategies in the long run. mediterranean most affected by new rusts  on the italian island of sicily, a new race of the stem rust pathogen -called ttttf- hit several thousands of hectares of durum wheat in 2016, causing the largest stem rust outbreak that europe has seen in decades. experience with similar races suggests that bread wheat varieties may also be susceptible to the new race. ttttf is the most recently identified race of stem rust. without proper control, researchers caution, it could soon spread over long distances along the mediterranean basin and the adriatic coast. various countries across africa, central asia and europe, meanwhile, have been battling new strains of yellow rust never before been seen in their fields. italy, morocco and four scandinavian countries have seen the emergence of an entirely new, yet-to-be-named race of yellow rust. notably, the new race was most prevalent in morocco and sicily, where yellow rust until recently was considered insignificant. preliminary analysis suggests the new race is related to a family of strains that are aggressive and better adapted to higher temperatures than most others. wheat farmers in ethiopia and uzbekistan, at the same time, have been fighting outbreaks of yellow rust af2012, another race which reared its head in both countries in 2016 and struck a major blow to ethiopian wheat production in particular. af2012 was previously only found in afghanistan, before appearing in the horn of africa country last year, where it affected tens of thousands of hectares of wheat. ""preliminary assessments are worrisome, but it is still unclear what the full impact of these new races will be on different wheat varieties in the affected regions,"" said dusunceli. ""that's what research institutions across these regions will need to further investigate in the coming months."" to offer support, fao, in collaboration with its partners, is stepping up its efforts in training rust experts from affected countries to boost their ability to detect and manage these emerging wheat rust races. as new races emerge, old ones continue to spread the already established warrior(-) race of yellow rust - which came onto scientists' radars in northern europe and turkey a few years ago -  continued its aerial march in 2016 and is now widely present in europe and west asia. the digalu (tifttf) race of stem rust continues to devastate wheats in ethiopia, while the most well-known race of stem rust - the highly potent ug99 - is now present in 13 countries. having spread in a northward trend from east africa to the middle east, ug99 has the potential to affect many wheat varieties grown worldwide as it keeps producing new variants. most recently, it has been detected in egypt, one of the middle east's most important wheat producers. international collaboration crucial the findings of the aarhus study build on training sessions conducted in 2016 in collaboration between the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas (icarda), aarhus university, cimmyt and fao.   the training, which will be repeated this year, allows rust experts to strengthen their surveillance and management skills, coupled with surveys and collection of rust samples for tests and analysis by aarhus university. the recently established regional cereal rust research in izmir, turkey, will host the training.    these efforts have been part of fao`s four-year global wheat rust program, which facilitates regional collaborations and offers support to individual countries eager to boost their surveillance capacity. it also helps countries act swiftly to control outbreaks before they turn into epidemics and cause major damage to food security. but further research, particularly into breeding resistant varieties, and national response plans need to be backed by adequate resources. fao, cimmyt, icarda and aarhus university are working together as members of the borlaug global rust initiative (bgri).",2021-04-16

""digitalization is a real engine to transform agri-food systems, from production through processing to the market,"" he said, noting that digital technologies can remodel agri-food systems so that production and trade would be driven by consumers. this would also reduce the impact of food loss and waste.  qu pointed out that fao has become more and more digital, and it is working towards the implementation of the international platform for digital food and agriculture, as he invited croplife international members to work with fao and its members. referring to the agreement giulia di tommaso described it as a ""milestone for both our organizations"" saying it would reinforce the common goal shared by fao and croplife international to build sustainable food systems, boost farmer resilience to climate change and address zero hunger.  the director-general also stressed that fao's hand-in-hand initiative , a country-owned and country-led initiative now operating in 22 countries, needed partners such as croplife international and its members to drive it forward by contributing valuable technical knowledge, practical know-how and capital. hand-in-hand brings together public and private donors in a matchmaking process to support rural development and eradicate poverty in the world's most vulnerable countries in line with the un sustainable development goals.  ""fao is the facilitator, we are the matchmaker,"" qu said. beth bechdol, fao deputy director-general, told the meeting fao was looking for ""on the ground impact"" and the un agency was focused on opening new channels of communication for private sector partners with fao's country offices and national governments. she said that fao is undergoing a cultural change, becoming more dynamic, forward-looking and opening up to new ways of work and collaboration. in this sense, bechdol mentioned that the organization is developing a new strategy for partnerships with the private sector, which will be submitted to evaluation of fao members before the end of 2020.  croplife international board members were enthusiastic about strengthening the organization's relationship with fao. liam condon, chairman of the croplife international board, described today's meeting as the start of a new journey. condon, went on to stress the importance of assisting smallholder farmers, saying there was a lot more companies could do together rather than individually, particularly by engaging with fao and its technical expertise. croplife international is a trade association, which promotes agricultural technologies such as pesticides and plant biotechnology. its members have been working with fao on a number of initiatives such as improving pesticide management and global action to tackle fall armyworm.(27 november 2020) editor<U+0092>s note: the food and agriculture organization (fao) received letters from a group of academics, scientists and researchers as well as from civil society and indigenous peoples<U+0092> organizations concerning the letter of intent signed with croplife international. as fao takes very seriously its mandate to act as an independent, neutral and honest broker to provide a forum where the best technical and social solutions are shared, and all relevant stakeholders are involved in our efforts to achieve zero hunger, the organization has attached to this article the responses to the aforementioned letters, as well as the letter of intent signed with croplife international.in this regard, the following documents can be accessed below: <U+0095> response letter to academics, scientists and researchers <U+0095> response letter to civil society and indigenous peoples organizations <U+0095> letter of intent between fao and croplife international",2021-04-16

""children who work long hours are likely to continue to swell the ranks of the hungry and poor. as  their families depend on their work,  this deprives the children of the opportunity to go to school, which in turn prevents them from getting decent jobs and income in the future,"" said fao deputy director-general (programmes), daniel gustafson. ""since more than 70 percent of child labour worldwide takes place in agriculture, it is vital to integrate child labour into national agricultural policies and address the issue at the household level. otherwise, it will further exacerbate poverty and hunger in rural areas. we need to break this vicious circle if we want to achieve progress towards the sustainable development goals. zero hunger is not possible without zero child labour,"" he added. what is child labour? child labour is defined as work that is inappropriate for a child's age, affects children's education, or is likely to harm their health, safety or morals. however, not all work carried out by children is considered child labour. some activities may help children acquire important livelihood skills and contribute to their survival and food security. yet, much of the work children carry out in agriculture is not appropriate for their age. it is often hazardous and can interfere with their wellbeing. for instance, when children work on fields treated with pesticides, stay up all night on fishing boats, or carry heavy loads, it can interfere with their social and physical development. a wider approach to eliminate child labour fao and its partners are trying to end the dependence of family farms and enterprises on child labour through improving skills of especially small family farmers, providing access to inputs and credit, especially for women, and implementing sustainable agricultural practices in order to improve productivity and make smallholder farms viable enough to employ adults in decent work. the organization also supports countries in integrating child labour in national policy, legislation, programmes and strategies. as part of its wider approach to eliminate child labour in agriculture, fao promotes efforts to boost the incomes of rural families so that they have the means to send their children to school rather than work. working with local communities and refugees fao has also developed country-tailored materials offering practical guidance, such as the handbook for monitoring and evaluating child labour in agricultural programmes and the facilitators' visual guide: protect children from pesticides! in lebanon, fao has developed a short visual story about the dangers of pesticides for younger children, who are potentially illiterate. it focuses especially on syrian refugee children. the agency is also working on a mobile app in the form of a game, which looks at risks and hazards associated with different agricultural settings such as horticulture, field crops and green houses. in uganda, fao, in coordination with the ministry of agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries and the ministry of labour, gender and social development, organizes trainings for local agricultural extension workers, labour officers, secondary school teachers and students to promote safe work for youth and prevent hazardous child labour in agriculture in several districts, including refugee hosting communities in the west nile.   key facts <U+0095> nearly three out of every four children in child labour are working in agriculture<U+0095> there are 10 million more children in agriculture since 2012<U+0095> of the 152 million child labourers, the vast majority - 108 million - are engaged in farming, livestock, forestry or aquaculture.<U+0095> nearly 70% of child labour is unpaid family labour.<U+0095> the incidence of child labour in countries affected by armed conflict is 77 per cent higher than the global average.<U+0095> nearly half of all child labour in the world now takes place in africa: 72 million, or one in five of africa<U+0092>s children, are in child labour and the vast majority is perfomed in agriculture, followed by asia with 62 million.",2021-04-16
"38","Key facts and findings","http://www.fao.org","by the numbers: ghg emissions by livestocktotal emissions from global livestock: 7.1 gigatonnes of co2-equiv per year, representing 14.5 percent of all anthropogenic ghg emissions. this figure is in line fao<U+0092>s previous assessment, livestock<U+0092>s long shadow, published in 2006, although it is based on a much more detailed analysis and improved data sets. the two figures cannot be accurately compared, as reference periods and sources differ.cattle (raised for both beef and milk, as well as for inedible outputs like manure and draft power) are the animal species responsible for the most emissions, representing about 65% of the livestock sector<U+0092>s emissions.in terms of activities, feed production and processing (this includes land use change) and enteric fermentation from ruminants are the two main sources of emissions, representing 45 and 39 percent of total emissions, respectively. manure storage and processing represent 10 percent. the remainder is attributable to the processing and transportation of animal products.cutting across all activities and all species, the consumption of fossil fuel along supply chains accounts for about 20 percent of the livestock sector<U+0092>s emissions.on a commodity-basis, beef and cattle milk are responsible for the most emissions, respectively, contributing 41 percent and 20 percent of the sector<U+0092>s overall ghg outputs. (this figure excludes emissions from cow manure and cattle used as draught power).they are followed by pig meat, (9 percent of emissions), buffalo milk and meat (8 percent), chicken meat and eggs (8 percent), and small ruminant milk and meat (6 percent). the remaining emissions are sourced to other poultry species and non-edible products.emission intensities (i.e. emissions per unit of product) vary from commodity to commodity. they are highest for beef (almost 300 kg co2-eq per kilogram of protein produced), followed by meat and milk from small ruminants (165 and 112kg co2-eq.kg respectively). cow milk, chicken products and pork have lower global average emission intensities (below 100 co2-eq/kg.)  (at the sub-global level, within each commodity type there is very high variability in emission intensitys, as a result of the different practices and inputs to production used around the world.enteric emissions and feed production (including manure deposition on pasture) dominate emissions from ruminant production. in pig supply chains, the bulk of emissions are related to the feed supply and manure storage in processing, while feed supply represents the bulk of emissions in poultry production, followed by energy consumption.about 44 percent of livestock emissions are in the form of methane (ch4). the remaining part is almost equally shared between nitrous oxide (n2o, 29 percent) and carbon dioxide (co2, 27 percent). this means that livestock supply chains emit:gt co2-eq of co2 per annum, or 5 percent of anthropogenic co2 emissions (ipcc, 2007)3.1 gt co2-eq of ch4 per annum, or 44 percent of anthropogenic ch4 emissions (ipcc, 2007)2 gt co2-eq of n2o per annum, or 53 percent of anthropogenic n2o emissions (ipcc, 2007)efficient practices key to reducing emissionsthere is a direct link between ghg emission intensities and the efficiency with which producers use natural resources, i.e. the amount of natural resources engaged in animal production, per unit of edible or non-edible output. for livestock production systems, nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide emissions are losses of nitrogen, energy and organic matter that undermine efficiency and productivity. possible interventions to reduce emissions are therefore to a large extent based on technologies and practices that improve production efficiency at animal and herd levels.while mitigation interventions will need to be tailored to local objectives and conditions, currently available mitigation options discussed in fao<U+0092>s assessment include:for ruminants <U+0096> cows, mainly -- the greatest promise involves improving animal and herd efficiency. this includes using better feeds and feeding techniques, which can reduce methane (ch4) generated during digestion as well as the amount of ch4 and nitrous oxide (n2o) released by decomposing manure.improved breeding and animal health interventions to allow herd sizes to shrink (meaning fewer, more productive animals) will also help. and manure management that ensures recovery and recycling of nutrients and energy, plus the use of energy saving devices, also have a role to play.additionally, better management of grazing lands could improve productivity and create carbon sinks with the potential to help offset livestock sector emissions.in monogastric production <U+0096> primarily poultry and pig farming <U+0096><U+0093>precision feeding,<U+0094> breeding, and better animal health care offer ways to reduce emissions due to feed production and manure management. switching to feed sources whose production is less energy-intensive, and to more sustainable sources of power would allow additional cuts.mitigation potentialthere is currently a wide variability in production practices, even within similar production systems. this results in a large variation of emission intensity within those systems <U+0096> what fao calls <U+0093>an emission intensity gap<U+0094>  between livestock operations that generate high emissions vs. those that put out low emissions per unit of product. fao<U+0092>s new report estimates that partially reducing this gap within existing production systems could cut emissions by about 30 percent.grassland carbon sequestration could further contribute to the mitigation effort by, with global estimates of about 0.6 gt

9 july 2019 the codex alimentarius commission has adopted new work on the development of guidelines for the control of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) in beef meat, leafy greens, raw milk and cheese produced from raw milk, and sprouts (sprouted seeds). stec are an important cause of foodborne disease, and infections have been associated with a range of illnesses from mild diarrhoea to kidney failure. the codex committee on food hygiene will develop the guideline to support risk management for stec in these commodities. new work on allergen labelling agreed - 9 july 2019 declaration of foods or ingredients known to cause hypersensitivity (referred to as allergen labelling) is intended to provide consumers with access to clear and accurate information on the presence of allergens (or substances) in foods, so that they can make safe food choices. this is particularly significant given the potential life-threatening consequences for food allergic individuals, and as the prevalence of conditions is increasing in many parts of the world.   given the serious nature of food allergies and their health consequences, and the increasing complexity of the food supply chain, this new work will supplement the current allergen labelling provisions in the general standard for labelling of pre-packaged foods. it will provide more detail for industry on how allergens should be presented on food labels to ensure consumer protection and promote harmonization of allergen labelling. this new work also complements the recent work by the codex committee on food hygiene (ccfh) on a draft code of practice on food allergen management for food business operators which provides guidance on allergen management throughout the food chain and promotes the inclusion of allergen management practices as part of good hygiene practices (ghps), and, where appropriate, haccp systems, in manufacturing, retail and food service. new work on internet sales/e-commerce  agreed - 9 july 2019 the way in which food is traded and sold directly to consumers in changing with internet/ e-commerce emerging globally as a new platform for selling food. this presents new challenges in terms of the way information on the quality and safety of foods is provided to customers.  currently there is a lack of standardised guidance for the labelling of food sold via internet sales/e-commerce which raises significant issues pertaining to health, food safety, and the protection of fair practices in the food trade. while some countries have adopted regulations specifically related to e-commerce, the growth of this platform and its transboundary nature means that it is important that some consistency is maintained at a global level to ensure that consumers are protected and impediments to trade that may arise from different approaches are minimized.  in line with its strategic plan to address emerging issues, the commission agreed to address this topical issue by undertaking new work on the labelling of food sold through internet sales/e-commerce. this new text will be supplementary to the general standard for the labelling of prepackaged foods.  guidelines for compounds of low public health concern that could be exempted from the establishment of maximum residue levels (mrls). agreed - 9 july 2019 as a result of growing public health concern expressed by scientific bodies, consumers, consumer health organizations and risk management agencies worldwide, the global regulatory scenario for pesticides of chemical origin is imposing increasing restrictions on this type of product. however, increasingly other types of plant protection products are becoming available, for example biopesticides.  the market for biopesticides has grown between 12 and 17 percent per year during the last 5 years, representing a growth two to three times faster than the market of chemical pesticides and non-chemical and biological control tools are playing an increasingly important role in the implementation of integrated pest management (ipm) approaches.  while these products are generally of low public health concern, it is nevertheless important that there are international standards to ensure their safe use. this new work aims to establish guidelines to harmonize the concepts and criteria for the recognition of pesticides that are of low public health concern and could be considered exempt from the establishment of codex mrls. establishment of maximum levels for aflatoxins in certain cereals and cereal-based products, including food for infants and young children  agreed - 9 july 2019global consumption of cereal and cereal-based products is high.  any level of aflatoxin contamination in these products could significantly contribute to total aflatoxin exposure.  aflatoxins are genotoxic human liver carcinogens, and among the most potent mutagenic and carcinogenic substances known. hepatitis b virus has been shown to be a critical contributor to the potency of aflatoxins in inducing liver cancer, with aflatoxin potency being 30 times higher in carriers of hepatitis b virus than in non-carriers.   currently, there is no codex maximum level (ml) for aflatoxins in cereal and cereal-based products. this new work will focus on the establishment of mls for maize grain destined for further processing and flour, meal, semolina and flakes derived from maize; husked and polished rice; cereal-based food for infants and young children and sorghum.  such mls could greatly contribute to a reduction in dietary exposure to aflatoxins.  draft guidelines for rapid risk analysis following instances of detection of contaminants in food where there is no regulatory level agreed - 9 july 2019 the detection of chemical contaminants in foods where there is no regulatory level is increasing due to both the diversity of the food supply and the continuing advancement of analytical capabilities. risk managers must respond to such detections in a manner that is adequately protective of public health and at the same time considers trade equity. the new guideline provides an approach to assist governments in rapid risk analysis of instances of detection of chemical contaminants in food where there is no regulatory level. by applying the rapid risk analysis approach the authorities can adequately protect public health while supporting food security and minimising food waste.  code of practice for the reduction of 3- monochloropropane1,2-diol esters (3- mcpdes) and glycidyl esters (ges) agreed <U+0096> 9 july 2019 the codex code of practice for the reduction of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters (3-mcpdes) and glycidyl esters (ges) in refined oils and food products made with refined oils will promote good manufacturing practices to help reduce the production of such contaminants to safe levels. consumers will continue to benefit from the good properties of these oils and developing countries can still count on an important item for trade and economic growth while protecting public health.  maximum limits for pesticide residues in foodagreed - 9 july 2019 the codex alimentarius commission has adopted maximum residue limits (mrls) for more than 30 different pesticides in various foods, including crops (barley, rye, and rice), vegetables (garlic, cucumber and peas), fruits (banana, orange and grape) and animal products (milk, eggs and poultry). it has been a significant achievement to translate the results of the fao/who expert meetings on pesticide residues into codex mrls in less than a year. pesticides are chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and other pests to prevent them from damaging crops. even when used in accordance with best practices, low levels of residues of pesticides can end up in food. the maximum limits aim to ensure pesticide residues do not harm people's health, and are based on risk assessments from the joint fao/who expert meeting on pesticide residues (jmpr).alignment of food additives and full integration into the general standard for food additives (gsfa)agreed - 9 july 2019 compromise reached at the codex committee on food additives (ccfa) has given the codex alimentarius commission (cac) the opportunity to recognise geographical variations in the use of food additives while agreeing global standards for their safety.  there are 27 functional classes for food additives including: preservatives, which prolong the shelf-life of a food by protecting against deterioration caused by microorganisms; antioxidants, which prolong the shelf-life of foods by protecting against deterioration caused by oxidation; stabilizers, which make it possible to maintain a uniform dispersion of two or more components; and colours, which add or restore colour in a food among others. the safety of food additives is evaluated by the joint fao/who expert committee on food additives (jecfa). the cac agreed that the use of trisodium citrate in fluid milk should be reconsidered by ccfa.almond oil, flaxseed oil, hazelnut oil, pistachio oil, and walnut oil,agreed - 8 july 2019 these oils are some of the oldest types of edible oil consumed by humankind and have been traditionally produced and consumed in middle eastern countries, africa, europe and south america. the oils are sought as healthy options due to their essential fatty acid and micronutrient content. this standard sets quality and as well as food safety criteria for these edible oils to facilitate international trade. palm oil with a higher content of oleic acid (oxg)agreed - 8 july 2019 over the last 20 years, global production and consumption of vegetable oils has increased significantly. this growth has been accompanied by a demand for healthier oils as well as oils that retain their quality for longer, such as palm oil. several countries have developed hybrids between the american oil palm, elaeis oleifera, and the african oil palm, elaeis guineensis. the palm oil extracted from the fruits of these hybrids has a higher oleic acid content recognized for its nutritional benefits. palm oil with a higher content of oleic acid (oxg) will be added to the standard for named vegetable oils (cxs 210-1999).standard for dried or dehydrated garlicagreed - 8 july 2019 with over 110 common spices it would be challenging to develop codex standards for them all. many spices and culinary herbs have common characteristics and similar quality profiles. the codex committee on spices and culinary herbs (ccsch) took a decision in 2017 to elaborate groups of standards by plant parts (as used in the spices and culinary herbs industry) to ease the development of quality specifications by eliminating duplication and thereby facilitating the work of competent authorities and regulators. the standard for dried or dehydrated garlic is an example of a grouping from the dried roots, rhizomes and bulbs category and applies to garlic in dried or dehydrated form, for direct consumption, as an ingredient in food processing, or for repacking if required. this standard does not apply to the product when intended for industrial processing. codex commodity standards contain the essential composition and quality of products in response to the codex dual mandate to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair practices in the food trade.related links: ·relevant codex document (rep19/sch para 40).",2021-04-16
"40","Pollinators vital to our food supply under threat","","26 february 2016, kuala lumpur -  - a growing number of pollinator species worldwide are being driven toward extinction by diverse pressures, many of them human-made, threatening millions of livelihoods and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of food supplies, according to the first global assessment of pollinators. however, the assessment, a two-year study conducted and released today by the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ipbes), also highlights a number of ways to effectively safeguard pollinator populations. the assessment, titled thematic assessment of pollinators, pollination and food production and the first ever issued by ipbes, is a groundbreaking effort to better understand and manage a critical element of the global ecosystem.  it is also the first assessment of its kind that is based on the available knowledge from science and indigenous and local knowledge systems.  ipbes was founded four years ago with 124 member nations to form a crucial intersection between international scientific understanding and public policy making.   pollinators are economically, socially and culturally important  ""pollinators are important contributors to world food production and nutritional security,"" said vera lucia imperatriz-fonseca, ph.d., co-chair of the assessment and senior professor at the university of são paulo. ""their health is directly linked to our own well-being."" there are more than 20,000 species of wild bees alone, plus many species of butterflies, flies, moths, wasps, beetles, birds, bats and other animals that contribute to pollination.  pollinated crops include those that provide fruit, vegetables, seeds, nuts and oils. many of these are important dietary sources of vitamins and minerals, without which the risks of malnutrition might be expected to increase. several crops also represent an important source of income in developing countries from, for example, the production of coffee and cocoa.  ""without pollinators, many of us would no longer be able to enjoy coffee, chocolate and apples, among many other foods that are part of our daily lives,"" said simon potts, ph.d., the other assessment co-chair and professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services, school of agriculture, policy and development, university of reading, united kingdommore than three-quarters of the world's food crops rely at least in part on pollination by insects and other animals.  between us$235 billion and us$577 billion worth of annual global food production relies on direct contributions by pollinators.   chocolate, for example, is derived from cacao tree seed (annual world cocoa bean crop value, us$5.7 billion).  cecidomyiid and ceratopogonid midges are essential for its pollination. the volume of agricultural production dependent on animal pollination has increased by 300 per cent during the past 50 years, but pollinator-dependent crops show lower growth and stability in yield than crops that do not depend on pollinators. nearly 90 per cent of all wild flowering plants depend at least to some extent on animal pollination.  in addition to food crops, pollinators contribute to crops that provide biofuels (e.g. canola and palm oils), fibers (e.g cotton), medicines, forage for livestock, and construction materials. some species also provide materials such as beeswax for candles and musical instruments, and arts and crafts. pollinators, especially bees, have also played a role throughout human history as inspirations for art, music, religion and technology.  additionally, they improve quality of life, globally significant heritage sites and practices, symbols of identify, aesthetically significant landscapes. sacred passages about bees occur in all major world religions. various factors affecting pollinators the assessment found that an estimated 16 per cent of vertebrate pollinators are threatened with global extinction -  increasing to 30 per cent for island species - with a trend towards more extinctions. although most insect pollinators have not been assessed at a global level, regional and national assessments indicate high levels of threat, particularly for bees and butterflies - with often more than 40 per cent of invertebrate species threatened locally. ""wild pollinators in certain regions, especially bees and butterflies, are being threatened by a variety of factors,"" said ipbes vice-chair, sir robert watson.  ""their decline is primarily due to changes in land use, intensive agricultural practices and pesticide use, alien invasive species, diseases and pests, and climate change.""  declines in regional wild pollinators have been confirmed for north western europe and in north america.  although local cases of decline have been documented in other parts of the world, data are too sparse to draw broad conclusions. the assessment found that pesticides, including neonicotinoid insecticides, threaten pollinators worldwide, although the long-term effects are still unknown. a pioneering study conducted in farm fields showed that one neonicotinoid insecticide had a negative effect on wild bees, but the effect on managed honeybees was less clear. ""while gaps remain in our knowledge of pollinators, we have more than enough evidence to act,"" prof. imperatriz-fonseca said. pests and diseases pose a special threat to managed bees, but the risk can be reduced through better disease detection and management, and regulations relating to trade and movement of bees.  genetically modified crops are usually either tolerant to herbicides or resistant to pest insects. the former reduces the availability of weeds, which supply food for pollinators. the latter often results in lower use of insecticides and may reduce pressure on beneficial insects including pollinators. however, the sub-lethal and indirect effects of gm crops on pollinators are poorly understood and not usually accounted for in risk assessments. pollinators are also threatened by the decline of practices based on indigenous and local knowledge. these practices include traditional farming systems; maintenance of diverse landscapes and gardens; kinship relationships that protect specific pollinators; and cultures and languages that are connected to pollinators.  numerous options exist to safeguard pollinators ""the good news is that a number of steps can be taken to reduce the risks to pollinators, including practices based on indigenous and local knowledge,"" said zakri abdul hamid, elected founding chair of ipbes at its first plenary meeting in 2012.   the safeguards include the promotion of sustainable agriculture, which helps to diversify the agricultural landscape and makes use of ecological processes as part of food production.  specific options include:  maintaining or creating greater diversity of pollinator habitats in agricultural and urban landscapes; supporting traditional practices that manage habitat patchiness, crop rotation, and coproduction between science and indigenous local knowledge; education and exchange of knowledge among farmers, scientists, industry, communities, and the general public; decreasing exposure of pollinators to pesticides by reducing their usage, seeking alternative forms of pest control, and adopting a range of specific application practices, including technologies to reduce pesticide drift; and improving managed bee husbandry for pathogen control, coupled with better regulation of trade and use of commercial pollinators.additional findings:  a high diversity of wild pollinators contributes to increased stability in pollination, even when managed bees are present in high numbers. crop yields depend on both wild and managed species.  the western honey bee is the most widespread managed pollinator in the world, producing an estimated 1.6 million tonnes of honey annually.  the number of beehives has increased globally over the past 50 years, but a decrease in hives has occurred in many european and north american countries.  climate change has led to changes in the distribution of many pollinating bumblebees and butterflies and the plants that depend upon them.the ipbes assessment has critically evaluated an enormous body of knowledge on pollinators, pollination and food production to ensure decision makers have access to the highest quality information. the assessment was compiled by a team of 77 experts from all over the world.  the assessment cites approximately 3,000 scientific papers and includes information about practices based on indigenous and local knowledge from more than 60 locations around the world. the assessment underwent two rounds of peer review involving experts and governments. comments   ""the growing threat to pollinators, which play an important role in food security, provides another compelling example of how connected people are to our environment, and how deeply entwined our fate is with that of the natural world. as we work towards food security, it is important to approach the challenge with a consideration of the environmental impacts that drive the issue. sustainable development, including improving food security for the world's population, necessitates an approach that embraces the environment.""  achim steiner, executive director, united nations environment programme (unep) ""in the context of the ipbes report on pollinators, pollination and food production, for the first time, science and indigenous knowledge have been brought together to assess an important biodiversity-dependent service - pollination - in support of food security and its contribution to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. unesco is pleased to have contributed directly to this effort."" irina bokova, director general, unesco ""pollination services are an 'agricultural input' that ensure the production of crops. all farmers, especially family farmers and smallholders around the world, benefit from these services. improving pollinator density and diversity has a direct positive impact on crop yields, consequently promoting food and nutrition security. hence, enhancing pollinator services is important for achieving the sustainable development goals, as well as for helping family farmers' adaptation to climate change."" josé graziano da silva, director-general, food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) ""the complex and integrated development challenges we face today demand that decision-making be based on sound science and takes into account indigenous and local knowledge. embracing science in areas such as pollination will contribute to better informed policy choices that will protect ecosystem services that are important for both food security and poverty eradication. undp is proactively contributing to promoting dialogue between scientists, policy-makers and practitioners on this and related topics, supporting countries in the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.""  nik sekhran, director/chief of profession, sustainable development, bureau for policy and programme support,  united nations development programme (undp)",2021-04-16

""massive agriculture intensification is contributing to increased deforestation, water scarcity, soil depletion and the level of greenhouse gas emission,"" graziano da silva said. he stressed that while high-input and resource intensive farming systems have substantially increased food production, this has come at a high cost to the environment. ""today, it is fundamental not only to increase production, but to do it in a way that does not damage the environment. nourishing people must go hand in hand with nurturing the planet,"" he said. this is in line with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the paris agreement on climate change, he added.""we have to move from input intense to knowledge intense production systems,"" the fao director-general said. the future of food and agriculture speaking to members of the european parliament's committee on agriculture and rural development, graziano da silva highlighted the findings of fao's report, the future of food and agriculture: trends and challenges. among the 15 trends described in the report, are the impacts of climate change, conflicts and migration. the fao report also foresees 10 challenges for achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture worldwide. in his address, the fao director-general focused on four main issues: climate change; the spread of transboundary pests and diseases; food loss and waste; and the importance of eradicating not only hunger, but all forms of malnutrition in the world. addressing climate change graziano da silva underscored that no sector is more sensitive to climate change than agriculture - especially for smallholders and family farmers from developing countries - while at the same time, agriculture and food systems account for around 30 percent of total greenhouse emissions. ""in agriculture, adaptation and mitigation go hand in hand. there is no trade-off between the two,"" the fao director-general said. he  pointed to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time building the resilience and promote the adaptation of farmers to the impacts of climate change.  to this end, fao supports countries through different initiatives and approaches, including climate-smart agriculture, agroecology and agro-forestry.  curbing the spread of transboundary pests and diseases globalization, trade and climate change, as well as reduced resilience in production systems, have all played a part in dramatically increasingly the spread of transboundary pests and disease in recent years. these constitute a major threat to the livelihoods of farmers and the food security of millions of people. for its part, fao supports countries to implement prevention and surveillance system. ""even in situations of conflict and protracted crises, we promote programmes of (livestock) vaccination, as we are currently doing is south sudan and somalia,"" the director-general said.   saving food today the world produces enough to feed the global population, but about one third of this food is either lost or wasted, while at the same time there is also a waste of natural resources such as land and water.   fao currently supports about 50 countries in the area of food losses and waste, including through the save food initiative, a unique partnership - with more than 850 members from industry, associations, research institutes and non-governmental organizations - that addresses these issues ""across the entire value chain from field to fork,"" graziano da silva told the european parliamentarians. the role of parliamentarians in combating malnutrition citing estimates that indicate that nearly half of the european union's adult population are overweight, the fao director-general noted how malnutrion affects both developed and developing countries. ""the way to combat this is to transform food systems, from production to consumption, and provide healthier diets to people,"" graziano da silva said. he called on the parliamentarians as lawmakers to ensure that adequate policies, programmes and operational frameworks are anchored in appropriate legislation. ""parliamentarians not only have the means to place nutrition at the highest level of the political and legislative agenda, they also can guarantee that programmes will have the necessary budgets for implementation,"" the fao director-general said. he also praised members of the european parliament for establishing the ""alliance fight against hunger"" which according to graziano da silva will play an important role in combating malnutrition in europe.",2021-04-16
"43","Desert Locust upsurge continues to threaten food security in Horn of Africa and Yemen despite intense efforts","http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html","16 december 2020, rome - a new generation of desert locust swarms is threatening agricultural and pastoral livelihoods and the food security of millions of people in the horn of africa and yemen despite intense efforts to control the pest throughout 2020, the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) said today. with international support and an unprecedented large-scale response campaign coordinated by fao, more than 1.3 million hectares of locust infestations have been treated in ten countries since january.   control operations have prevented the loss of an estimated 2.7 million tonnes of cereal, worth nearly $800 million, in countries already hard hit by acute food insecurity and poverty. that is enough to feed 18 million people a year. however, favourable weather conditions and widespread seasonal rains have caused extensive breeding in eastern ethiopia and somalia. this was worsened by cyclone gati which brought flooding to northern somalia last month allowing locust infestations to increase further in the coming months. new locust swarms are already forming and threatening to re-invade northern kenya and breeding is also underway on both sides of the red sea, posing a new threat to eritrea, saudi arabia, the sudan and yemen. ""we have achieved much, but the battle against this relentless pest is not yet over,"" said the director-general of fao, qu dongyu. ""we must not waver. locusts keep growing day and night and risks are exacerbating food insecurity for vulnerable families across the affected region."" fao is assisting governments and other partners with surveillance and coordination, technical advice and the procurement of supplies and equipment but operations must be further scaled up to safeguard food production and prevent worsening food insecurity in the affected countries. donors and partners have so far provided nearly $200 million to finance control efforts, allowing fao and governments to rapidly scale up locust response capacity in a region that has not faced an upsurge of the pest on this scale in generations. over 1,500 ground survey and control personnel have been trained and 110 vehicle mounted ground sprayers and 20 aircraft are now in action.  fao is now seeking a further $40 million to increase surveillance and control activities in the most affected countries - ethiopia, kenya, somalia, the sudan and yemen - in 2021. more than 35 million people are already acutely food insecure in these five countries and fao estimates this number could increase by another 3.5 million, if nothing is done to control the latest outbreak.  rural livelihoods must be protected fao is not only working with governments and partners on control operations. the organization is taking action to safeguard and protect rural livelihoods by providing affected growers with farming packages, veterinary care and feed for vegetation-starved livestock, and cash for families who have lost their crops so that they can cope until their next harvest. over 200 000 households have already received livelihood assistance and that number is expected to increase. fao will assist an additional 98 000 households in early 2021 and is appealing for continuous support, mainly through humanitarian response plans.  without additional funding, control efforts could slow down or halt from the end of january 2021, potentially allowing the numbers of the crop-devouring pest to surge in some places. farmers, whose livelihoods have been impacted, require further support and national capacities in monitoring and responding to desert locust still need to be strengthened. funding has been received from belgium, canada, china, denmark, the european union, france, germany, italy, the netherlands, norway, russian federation, saudi arabia, sweden, switzerland, united arab emirates, united kingdom, united states of america, the african development bank, the africa solidarity trust fund, the bill and melinda gates foundation, the louis dreyfus foundation, the mastercard foundation, the un's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs' central emergency response fund (cerf), and the world bank group. desert locust monitoring, forecasting and control are at the heart of fao's mandate. its desert locust information service has been in operation for nearly 50 years. fao's well-established field presence, ability to link up authorities from different countries, and expertise in desert locust management make it a key player in responding to upsurges like that currently affecting east africa.",2021-04-16
"44","Joint statement from FAO, IFAD and WFP on international food prices","","4 september 2012, rome - following is a joint statement on international food prices from the three rome-based un agencies, the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), the international fund for agricultural  development (ifad) and the world food programme (wfp):                                                                             tackling the root causes of high food prices and hunger by josé graziano da silva, kanayo f. nwanze and ertharin cousin*the current situation in world food markets, characterized by sharp increases in maize, wheat and soybean prices, has raised fears of a repeat of the 2007-2008 world food crisis. but swift, coordinated international action can stop that from happening. we need to act urgently to make sure that these price shocks do not turn into a catastrophe hurting tens of millions over the coming months.two interconnected problems must be tackled: the immediate issue of some high food  prices, which can impact heavily on food import-dependent countries and on the poorest people; and the long-term issue of how we produce, trade and consume food in an age of increasing population, demand and climate change. in responding to those challenges, we are better placed today than five years ago. we have developed new policies and new instruments, like the united nations high-level task force on global food security and amis, the g20's agricultural markets information system, which improves transparency in global markets. we also have the amis-related rapid response forum, set up to facilitate coordinated policy responses by the major world producers and traders of key cereals and soybeans in the event of market upheavals. we have learned that not all are affected in the same way - the urban and rural poor and people in food import-dependent countries are most vulnerable to international commodity price increases, when these are transmitted to local markets, because they spend the largest proportions of their incomes on food. we have also learned that smallholder farmers, many of whom are also poor and food insecure, can be enabled to benefit from higher food prices and become part of the solution by reducing price spikes and improving overall food security. we have thus adopted a twin-track approach which supports long-term investments in agriculture, notably smallholder agriculture, while ensuring that safety-nets are in place to help poor food consumers and producers avoid hunger, asset losses and poverty traps in the short run.many countries have social protection systems including safety nets - such as assistance for smallholder farmers, nutritional support to mothers and children, and school meals - to ensure that their poorest citizens have enough to eat; yet, these need to be expanded significantly in poorer countries. safety nets that are affordable, predictable and transparent are an absolute must if we are to safeguard against recurring price shocks and crises.  small-scale food producers also need to be better equipped to raise their productivity, increase their access to markets and reduce their exposure to risk. and, of course, people need decent jobs and incomes so that they can afford the food they need and escape from poverty.in responding to high food prices, the things we must avoid doing are just as important as the things we should do. in particular, countries must avoid panic buying and refrain from imposing export restrictions which, while temporarily helping some consumers at home, are generally inefficient and make life difficult for everyone else. above all, however, we must understand that high food prices are a symptom, and not the disease. so while the international community must take early action to prevent excessive price increases, it should also move to act on the root causes behind such surges. there have been three international food price spikes in the last five years. weather has been among the drivers of each. droughts in some part of the world have impaired global grain production virtually every other year since 2007. elsewhere, major floods have also caused severe damage to crops. increased diversion of food stock for non-food purposes and increased financial speculation are among the various drivers of increased  price levels and volatility. until we find the way to shock-proof and climate-proof our food system, the danger will remain. in the short term, this has costs, not only for those directly impacted, but also for the international community at large. for instance, the world food programme (wfp) estimates that every 10 per cent increase in the price of its food basket means it has to find an extra $200 million a year for food assistance.we are vulnerable because even in a good year, global grain production is barely sufficient to meet growing demands for food, feed and fuel - this, in a world where there are 80 million extra mouths to be fed every year. we are at risk because only a handful of nations are large producers of staple food commodities, and when they are affected, so is everyone else. the challenge - and the opportunity - is both to reduce and to spread that risk. and the most obvious way is to promote sustainable food production in poor, food-importing countries, where there is often huge potential to improve production. that would make more food available in local markets and provide jobs and income, especially in rural areas where 70 per cent of the world's poor live. we should also address the fact that, globally, one third of food produced is wasted or lost to spoilage, damage and other causes.the food and agriculture organization of the un (fao), the international fund for agricultural development (ifad) and the world food programme are helping poor people to eat today while building their resilience and capacity to feed themselves tomorrow. but more needs to be done.we need to invest much more in agriculture and social protection, including programmes that help poor people to access food that has become unaffordable in their local markets.lastly, we also need to review and adjust where applicable policies currently in place that encourage alternative uses of grains. for example, adjusting biofuel mandates when global markets come under pressure and food supplies are endangered has been recommended by a group of international organizations including fao, ifad, the international monetary fund, the organisation for economic co-operation and development, the un conference on trade and development, wfp, the world bank and the world trade organization. that recommendation, made to the 2011 g20 summit in paris, still stands today. in moving to prevent a possible deterioration of the situation, we need to remain vigilant and prepare for the worst in the short run, while working on sustainable solutions for the long haul. not to do so would inevitably mean that the world's poorest and most vulnerable pay the highest price. getting this right will help us respond to the ""zero hunger"" challenge set by un secretary-general ban ki-moon of eradicating hunger from the globe.*the authors are respectively the director-general of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, the president of the international fund for agricultural development and the executive director of the un world food programme.",2021-04-16

""this project aims to establish an effective network of community conservancies since they have proven to be  a powerful means to combat rural poverty,"" said gilles kleitz, director of the afd ecological transition and natural resources department. ""in namibia, for instance, conservancies contributed more than $10 million in benefits such as income, employment remuneration, and in-kind, for example meat, to conservancy members in 2018.  the overall economic contributions from these benefits amounted to more than $62 million, including the creation of over 5,300 jobs from conservancy related operations and enterprises.""  the project will be implemented with the support of technical partners such as wild entrust africa in botswana and the world wildlife fund in namibia and will focus on botswana's khaudum -ngamiland wildlife dispersal area as well as in namibia's community conservancies of the zambezi region and around khaudum national park. the results of the project will contribute to the creation of policies aimed at fostering community conservancies development, sustainable hunting and wildlife conservation and enhanced institutional and legal frameworks needed to implement these policies. the sustainable wildlife management programme is already promoting a similar approach in zambia and zimbabwe. it also ensures a participatory and community rights-based approach across all its sites. about the french development agency (afd) the french development agency is a public institution that implements france's policy in the areas of development and international solidarity. the teams carry out more than 4,000 projects in france's overseas departments and territories and another 115 countries to support the sustainable development goals (sdgs). about the sustainable wildlife management programme the sustainable wildlife management programme is an organisation of african, caribbean and pacific states (oacps) initiative, funded by the european union with co-funding from the french facility for global environment (ffem). it develops innovative, collaborative and scalable new approaches to conserve wild animals and protect ecosystems, while at the same time improving the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and rural communities who depend on these resources.  the swm programme is being implemented by fao, the french agricultural research centre for international development (cirad), the center for international forestry research (cifor) and the wildlife conservation society (wcs).",2021-04-16

""soils are not only the foundation of agri-food systems and where 95 percent of the foods we eat is produced, but their health and biodiversity are also central to our efforts to end hunger and achieve sustainable agri-food systems,"" said fao director-general qu dongyu at the world soil day ceremony today.  however, the fao chief pointed to the decline in soil health and numerous ecosystem services they provide. to avoid dramatic consequences this trend may have on food security, nutrition, climate change and sustainable development, he called for urgent actions to unlock the potential of living genetic resources in soils.  in his remarks, qu also highlighted the need for establishing an efficient global soil information system in line with digital agriculture and innovations in environmetrics, to protect our ""silent, dedicated heroes"" as he referred to soil organisms. ""as a chinese proverb says: soil is the mother of all creatures on earth. do not forget the mother when you are getting nourishment from,"" the director-general said.  soils are one of the main global reservoirs of biodiversity. they host more than 25 percent of the world's biological diversity. in addition, more than 40 percent of living organisms in terrestrial ecosystems are associated with soils during their life cycle. elizabeth maruma mrema, executive secretary of convention on biological biodiversity, in her video address to the ceremony, said: ""we urgently need to recognize that soil biodiversity is indispensable to food security and the achievement of the sustainable development goals. soil biodiversity underpins the productivity and resilience of agriculture, making production systems and livelihoods more resilient to shocks and stresses.""  the glinka world soil prize and the king bhumibol world soil day award winners announced  during the ceremony, the glinka world soil prize 2020, named after the pioneering russian scientist konstantin d. glinka, was awarded to the italian agricultural scientist, luca montanarella from the european commission. the glinka gold-plated medal was presented to the winner by the fao director-general. montanarella is recognized as an active promoter of soil awareness in europe and worldwide, supporting the transfer of scientific knowledge on soils into policy development.  presenting the monetary reward, victor vasiliev, permanent representative of the russian federation to fao, stressed the importance of promoting agroecological approaches in farming which give more attention to enriching soil biodiversity. he cited organic farming, no till farming, crop rotation and conservation farming as good examples of such techniques.  the king bhumibol world soil day award, named after the late king of thailand, was conferred to the indian council of agricultural research (icar), for its commitment to raising awareness of the importance of healthy soils. her royal highness, princess maha chakri sirindhorn of thailand, will officially present the prize to icar in bangkok in january 2021. thanawat tiensin, permanent representative of thailand to fao, said that the current pandemic showed us how precious and fragile our health is, and to protect it we need to start from our soil. this in turn requires protecting its biodiversity.  in the framework of world soil day 2020, fao together with international union of soil sciences (iuss), and the global soil partnership (gsp) has also announced the winners of the scientific children's book contest on soil biodiversity. the first prize went to ""the science and spectacle of soil life by roly poly"" by jiajia hamner (freelance, united states) and sharada keats (global alliance for improved nutrition, united kingdom). see here the full list of winners. laura bertha, president of the international union of soil science, who announced the winners, said that soil degradation is the most insidious challenge, and to overcome it, our activities should focus on educating children and young people. the event also saw the launch of the armenian soil information system.  threats to soil biodiversity the new fao report defines soil biodiversity as the variety of life below-ground, from genes and species to the communities they form, as well as the ecological complexes to which they contribute and to which they belong, from soil micro-habitats to landscapes.  the role of soil biodiversity through the ecosystem services they provide is critical for agriculture and food security. for example, soil microorganisms transform organic and inorganic compounds releasing nutrients in a form that plants can feed on. in addition, soils diversity contributes to improving the control, prevention, or suppression of pests and pathogens.  however, soil biodiversity is threatened by human activities, climate change and natural disasters. the overuse and misuse of agrochemicals remains one of the major causes of soil biodiversity loss, thus reducing the potential of soil biodiversity. other causes include deforestation, urbanization, agricultural intensification, pollution, and salinization.  soil biodiversity and human well-being soil microorganisms have a significant potential to mitigate climate change. they play a key role in carbon sequestration and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. the report finds that farming activities are the biggest source of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide gases emitted by soils.  soil biodiversity supports human health, both directly and indirectly. several soil bacteria and fungi are traditionally used in the production of soy sauce, cheese, wine, and other fermented food and beverages. plants produce chemicals such as antioxidants that stimulate our immune system and contribute to hormone regulation. soil microorganisms can also help prevent chronic inflammatory diseases, including allergy, asthma, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and depression.  since the early 1900s, many drugs and vaccines have been derived from soil organisms, from well-known antibiotics such as penicillin to bleomycin used to treat cancer and amphotericin for fungal infections. in a context of increasing diseases caused by resistant microorganisms, soil biodiversity has enormous potential to provide new drugs to combat them. the way forward generally, there is a lack of detailed data, policies and actions on soil biodiversity at local, national, regional, and global levels. in order to better understand the threats to soil biodiversity and implement relevant policies and regulations, it is crucial to invest in harmonized soil biodiversity assessments worldwide, standardize sampling and analysis protocols to enable the collection of large comparable datasets, and promote the use of efficient monitoring tools to record changes in soil biodiversity. the publication also underscores the need to promote innovative technologies in soil management. for instance, new molecular techniques using next-generation molecular sequencing allow a better understanding of soil organisms and the effects these organisms may have on associated cropping systems.",2021-04-16

"52","UN strengthens regulations on lead in infant formula and arsenic in rice","","17 july 2014, geneva - un food standards body the codex alimentarius commission this week adopted new standards to protect consumer health worldwide, including setting out maximum acceptable levels of lead in infant formula and of arsenic in rice. jointly run by the un food and agriculture organization (fao) and the world health organization (who), the codex alimentarius commission sets international food safety and quality standards to promote safer and more nutritious food for consumers worldwide. codex standards serve in many cases as a basis for national legislation, and provide the food safety benchmarks for international food trade.the annual meeting this week was attended by representatives from 170 countries and the european union, as well as 30 international governmental and non-governmental organizations.lead in infant formulathe codex alimentarius commission adopted a recommendation that no more than 0.01 mg per kg of lead should be permitted in infant formula as consumed. infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead. they can suffer profound and permanent adverse health effects, particularly affecting the development of the brain and nervous system, which can diminish their ability to learn.lead occurs in the environment and trace amounts can end up in the ingredients that are used in the production of infant formula.levels of lead in infant formula can be controlled by sourcing raw materials from areas where lead is less present.arsenic in ricefor the first time, codex has adopted a maximum level for arsenic in rice of 0.2 mg/kg.long-term exposure to arsenic can cause cancer and skin lesions. it has also been associated with developmental effects, heart disease, diabetes, and damage to the nervous system and brain.arsenic is naturally present at high levels in the groundwater and soil in some parts of the world. the toxic element can enter the food chain when it is absorbed by crops from water and soil. rice in particular can take up more arsenic than other crops and as a staple food for millions of people can contribute significantly to arsenic exposure, which is detrimental to human health. arsenic contamination in rice is of particular concern in some asian countries where paddy fields are irrigated with groundwater containing arsenic-rich sediments pumped from shallow tube wells. improved irrigation and agricultural practices can help reduce arsenic contamination, for example growing crops in raised beds instead of flooded fields. the commission also agreed to develop a new code of practice that will help countries comply with the maximum level set and provide producers with good agricultural and manufacturing techniques to prevent and reduce contamination.veterinary drugscodex recommended that the use of certain veterinary drugs should be restricted in food-producing animals in order to prevent residual amounts of the drugs remaining in meat, milk, eggs or honey. the eight drugs (chloramphenicol, malachite green, carbadox, furazolidone, nitrofural, chlorpromazine, stilbenes and olaquinadox), including antimicrobials and growth promoters, can potentially have adverse effects on human health and may contribute to the development of drug resistance.other measurescountries also agreed on maximum levels of pesticide residues and additives in foods as well as maximum levels of contaminants, including toxins called fumonisins that are produced by mould growing on maize. other measures include new safety and quality standards for foods such as raw scallops, passion fruit, durian and okra.future workcountries decided on a range of topics for future development, including establishing standards for black, white and green pepper, cumin, oregano, thyme and garlic, and setting maximum levels for cadmium in chocolate and cocoa-derived products.the commission also discussed the need for a codex standard for ready-to-eat foods for malnourished children, on the proposal from unicef, to guarantee the safety and quality of such foods. the commission decide to follow up on this discussion at its committee on nutrition and foods for special dietary uses.",2021-04-16
"53","Rural areas, too long seen as poverty traps, key to economic growth in developing countries","http://www.fao.org/3/a-I7658e.pdf","9 october 2017, rome - millions of young people in developing countries who are poised to enter the labour force in the coming decades need not flee rural areas to escape poverty, argues a new fao report published today. rural areas actually have vast potential for economic growth pegged to food production and related sectors, the state of food and agriculture 2017 says. and with the majority of the world's poor and hungry living in these areas, achieving the 2030 development agenda will hinge on unlocking that oft-neglected potential, it adds. doing so will require overcoming a thorny combination of low productivity in subsistence agriculture, limited scope for industrialization in many places, and rapid population growth and urbanization <U+0097> all of which pose challenges to developing nations' capacity to feed and employ their citizens. there is ample evidence that changes to rural economies can have major impacts. transformations of rural economies have been credited with helping hundreds of millions of rural people lift themselves up out of poverty since the 1990s, the report notes. however that progress has been patchy, and demographic growth is raising the stakes. between 2015 and 2030, the ranks of people aged 15-24 years are expected to rise by about 100 million, to 1.3 billion. almost all that increase will take place in sub-saharan africa <U+0097> the lion's share of it in rural zones. but in many developing countries <U+0097> most notably in south asia and sub-saharan africa <U+0097> growth in the industrial and service sectors has lagged, and they will not be able to absorb the massive numbers of new job seekers set to enter the workforce. nor will agriculture <U+0097> in its current form. so rural people who relocate to cities will likely run a greater risk of joining the ranks of the urban poor, instead of finding a pathway out of poverty. others will need to look for employment elsewhere, leading to seasonal <U+0097> or permanent <U+0097> migration. this is why targeting policy support and investment to rural areas to build vibrant food systems and supporting agro-industries that are well connected to urban zones <U+0097>especially small and medium size cities <U+0097> will create employment and allow more people to stay, and thrive, in the countryside  represents a strategic intervention, today's report says. transformed rural economies won't necessarily be a panacea that solves all the pressures that drive people to relocate, but they will generate much-needed jobs and contribute to making out-migration more of a choice, rather than a necessity.""too often ignored by policy-makers and planners, territorial networks of small cities and towns are important reference points for rural people <U+0097> the places where they buy their seed, send their children to school and access medical care and other services,"" fao director-general josé graziano da silva notes in his forward to the report. ""policy-makers are urged to recognize the catalytic role of small cities and towns in mediating the rural-urban nexus and providing smallholder farmers with greater opportunities to market their produce and share in the benefits of economic growth,"" he adds.how urban food demand can spark rural renewalthe state of food and agriculture makes the case that needed transformations in rural economies can be sparked by leveraging growing demand for food in urban areas to diversify food systems and generate new economic opportunities in off-farm, agriculture -related activities. this includes enterprises that process or refine, package or transport, and store, market or sell food, as well as businesses that supply production inputs such as seeds, tools and equipment, and fertilizers or provide irrigation, tilling or other services already, growing demand coming from urban food markets currently consumes up to 70 percent of national food supplies, even in countries with large rural populations, the report notes.no silver bulletsbut while urbanization provides a ""golden opportunity"" for agriculture, it also presents challenges for millions of small-scale family farmers.  markets that are more profitable can lead to the concentration of food production in large commercial farms, to value chains dominated by large processors and retailers, and to the exclusion of smallholders. so supportive public policies and investments will be key to harnessing urban demand as an engine for transformative and equitable growth, and measures designed to ensure market participation by small-scale, family-farmers must be hard-wired into policies.family farmers, infrastructure, small cities and townsthe study lays out three lines for action: the first involves putting in place a range of policies designed to ensure that small-scale producers are able to participate fully in meeting urban food demands. measures to strengthen land tenure rights, ensure equity in supply contracts, or improve access to credit are but a few options. the second is to build up the necessary infrastructure to connect rural areas and urban markets <U+0097> in many developing countries the lack of rural roads, electrical power grids, storage facilities, and refrigerated transportation systems is a major bottleneck for farmers seeking to take advantage of urban demand for fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy. the third involves including not just mega-cities into well-connected rural-urban economies but knitting in smaller, more spread-out urban areas as well. indeed, the report stresses that smaller urban centres represent a much overlooked market for food. half of all urban dwellers in developing countries live in cities and towns of fewer than 500,000 people.  key numbers rural transformation have been taking place since the 1990s; since then, an additional 750 million rural people now have incomes above the moderate poverty line of us$3.10 (ppp) per person per day in 1960, 22 percent of the population in developing countries (460 million people) lived in cities and towns. by 2015, that reached 49 percent (3 billion people). the developing world's rural population grew by 1.5 billion between 1960 (1.6 billion people) and 2015 (3.1 billion). in south asia and sub-saharan africa, an average of 1 million and 2.2 million young people, respectively, entered the job market every year between 2010 and 2015. large cities with populations from 5-10 million and megacities of 10+ million inhabitants are represent only about 20 percent of the world's urban dwellers. in developing countries most urban areas are relatively small - about 50 percent of the total urban population, or 1.45 billion people, live in cities and towns of 500 000 inhabitants or fewer. close to half the global population today either lives in cities with fewer than 500 000 inhabitants or in rural areas surrounding them.  globally, smaller urban areas currently account for about 60 percent of urban food demand. by 2030, the urban population in the world's less-developed regions will total 4 billion. 80 percent of these urban dwellers will live in africa, asia and latin america. in 2030 the majority of the world's urban population will be found in cities with populations of 1 million or less; 80 percent of these people will live in urban areas with fewer than 500 000 inhabitants. the value of urban food markets in sub-saharan africa will likely increase fourfold between 2010 and 2030, from us$313 billion to us$1 trillion. in east and southern africa, the share of urban consumers in the purchased food market is already 52 percent and is forecast to rise to 67 percent by 2040.",2021-04-16
"54","New UN report reveals that hunger in Africa continues to rise","http://www.fao.org/3/CA2710EN/ca2710en.pdf","13 february 2019, addis ababa - hunger in africa continues to rise after many years of decline, threatening the continent's hunger eradication efforts to meet the malabo goals 2025 and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, particularly the sustainable development goal 2 (sdg2). new data presented in the joint un report, the africa regional overview of food security and nutrition, released today, indicates that 237 million people in sub-saharan africa are suffering from chronic undernutrition, derailing the gains made in the past years. the joint report by the regional office for africa of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) and the united nations economic commission for africa (eca) was launched today in addis ababa at an event presided by fao's deputy director-general climate and natural resources, maria helena semedo. it shows that more people continue to suffer from undernourishment in africa than in any other region - evidence suggests that in 2017, 20 percent of the african population was undernourished. ""the worsening trend in africa is due to difficult global economic and worsening environmental conditions and, in many countries, conflict and climate variability and extremes, sometimes combined. economic growth slowed in 2016 due to weak commodity prices, in particular for oil and minerals. food insecurity has worsened in countries affected by conflict, often exacerbated by drought or floods. for example, in southern and eastern africa, many countries suffered from drought,"" fao assistant director-general and regional representative for africa, abebe haile-gabriel, and eca executive secretary, vera songwe, said in their joint foreword of the report. of the 257 million hungry people in africa, 237 million are in sub-saharan africa and 20 million in northern africa. the annual un report indicates that compared to 2015, there were an additional 34.5 million more undernourished people in africa, of which 32.6 million in sub-saharan africa and 1.9 million in northern africa. nearly half of the increase is due to the rise in the number of undernourished people in western africa, while another third is from eastern africa. at the regional level, the prevalence of stunting in children under five is falling, but only few countries are on track to meet the global nutrition target for stunting. the number of overweight children under five continues to rise and is particularly high in northern and southern africa. according to the regional report, progress towards meeting the world health organization's global nutrition targets is slow at the continental level. in many countries, notably in eastern and southern africa, adverse climatic conditions due to el niño led to a decline in agricultural production and soaring staple food prices. the economic and climatic situation has improved in 2017, but some countries continue to be affected by drought or poor rainfall. greater efforts and collaboration needed to achieve sdg 2 the report reveals that more efforts are needed to achieve sdg2 and the global nutrition targets amidst the important challenges faced by the continent, such as tackling youth employment and climate change. agriculture and the rural sector must play a key role in creating decent jobs for the 10 to 12 million youths that join the labour market each year. another present and growing threat to food security and nutrition in africa, particularly to countries relying heavily on agriculture, is climate change. the effects of climate change, reduced precipitation and higher temperatures negatively influence the yields of staple food crops. at the same time, there are significant opportunities for agriculture in developing intra-african trade, harnessing remittances for development, and investing in youth. remittances from international and internal migration play an important role in reducing poverty and hunger as well as stimulating productive investments. international remittances amount to nearly $70 billion, about three percent of africa's gdp, and present an opportunity for national development that governments should work on to strengthen. the signing of the african continental free trade area agreement provides an opportunity to accelerate growth and sustainable development by increasing trade, including trade in agricultural products. although agricultural intra-african exports rose from $2 billion in 2000 to $13.7 billion in 2013, they remain relatively modest and often informal. the report highlights that opening trade of food also carries risks to consumer and producer welfare, and governments should avoid using trade policy for multiple objectives but rather combine trade reform with additional instruments, such as safety nets and risk-mitigating programmes, to achieve food security and nutrition goals. call for greater action to address the threat from climate variability and extremes this year's regional overview, entitled, ""addressing the threat from climate variability and extremes for food security and nutrition,"" illustrates that climate variability and extremes, in part due to climate change, are important factors underlying the recent rise in food insecurity and severe food crises on the continent. many countries in africa are at great risk to climate-related disasters and suffer from them frequently. over the last ten years, climate-related disasters affected on average 16 million people and caused annually $0.67 billion in damages across the continent. although not all of these shorter-term climate variations may be attributable to climate change, the evidence presented shows that more numerous and more frequent occurrences of climate extremes and a rise in climate variability are threatening to erode gains made towards ending hunger and malnutrition. fao and eca stressed, ""greater urgency in building resilience of households, communities and countries to climate variability and extremes is needed. we need to face myriad of challenges to building institutional capacity in designing, coordinating and scaling up actions for risk monitoring and early warning systems, emergency preparedness and response, vulnerability reduction measures, shock-responsive social protection, and planning and implementing resilience-building measures. strategies towards climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction must be aligned as well as coordinated with interventions in nutrition and food systems across sectors."" in terms of developing climate adaptation strategies and implementation, the report highlights the need for greater efforts in data collection, monitoring and implementation of climate smart agriculture practices. continued efforts through partnerships, blending climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, and long-term financing can bridge humanitarian and development approaches. key facts and figures  number of hungry people in africa: 257 million or 1 in every 5 people

""there is justifiable concern that the current dependence of the food sector on fossil fuels may limit the sector's ability to meet global food demands. the challenge is to decouple food prices from fluctuating and rising fossil fuel prices,"" according to an fao paper published today during the un conference on climate change.high and fluctuating prices of fossil fuels and doubts regarding their future availability mean that agri-food systems need to shift to an ""energy-smart"" model, according to the report energy-smart food for people and climate. the food sector both requires energy and can produce energy <U+0097> an energy-smart approach to agriculture offers a way to take better advantage of this dual relationship between energy and food, it says.the food sector (including input manufacturing, production, processing, transportation marketing and consumption) accounts for around 95 exa-joules (1018 joules), according to the report <U+0097> approximately 30 percent of global energy consumption <U+0097> and produces over 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.on-farm direct energy use amounts to around 6 exa-joules per year, if human and animal power are excluded <U+0097> just over half of that is in oecd countries. on farms, energy is used for pumping water, housing livestock, cultivating and harvesting crops, heating protected crops, and drying and storage. after harvest, it is used in processing, packaging, storing, transportation and consumption.new approach to farming""the global food sector needs to learn how to use energy more wisely. at each stage of the food supply chain, current practices can be adapted to become less energy intensive,"" said fao assistant director-general for environment and natural resources, alexander mueller.such efficiency gains can often come from modifying at no or little cost existing farming and processing practices, he added.steps that can be taken at the farm level include the use of more fuel efficient engines, the use of compost and precision fertilizers, irrigation monitoring and targeted water delivery, adoption of no-till farming practices and the use of less-input-dependent crop varieties and animal breeds.after food has been harvested, improved transportation and infrastructure, better insulation of food storage facilities, reductions in packaging and food waste, and more efficient cooking devices offer the possibility of additionally reducing energy use in the food sector.adding up both on-farm and post-harvest losses, around one-third of all food produced <U+0097> and the energy that is embedded in it <U+0097> is lost or wasted, fao's report notes.making agriculture less fossil fuel dependentfao's report also highlights the tremendous potential for agriculture to produce more of the energy needed to feed the planet and help rural development.""using local renewable energy resources along the entire food chain can help improve energy access, diversify farm and food processing revenues, avoid disposal of waste products, reduce dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, and help achieve sustainable development goals,"" it says.where good solar, wind, hydro, geothermal or biomass energy resources exist, they can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels in farming and aquaculture operations. they can also be used in food storage and processing. for example, sugar mills frequently use their residue materials for combined heat and power generation. so-called ""wet processing wastes"" like tomato rejects and skins, or pulp from juice processing, can be used in anaerobic digester plants to produce biogas. already, millions of small-scale domestic digesters are being used by subsistence farmers in the development world to produce biogas for home use.significant action is needed to reduce food losses, and this will also improve energy efficiency in the agri-food chain.finally it is essential to improve access to modern energy services to the millions of people who still use biomass in a nontraditional way as energy for cooking and heating. a long row to hoetransitioning to an energy-smart agricultural sector will be a ""huge undertaking"" that will require long-term thinking, and needs to start now, fao says.during the climate talks in durban, the un agency is advocating ""energy-smart food for people and climate,"" an approach based on three pillars: (i) providing energy access for all with a focus on rural communities; (ii) improving energy efficiency at all stages of the food supply chain; and (iii) substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy systems in the food sector.""the key question at hand is not, <U+0091>if or when we should begin the transition to energy-smart food systems?' but rather <U+0091>how can we get started and make gradual but steady progress?"" said mueller.",2021-04-16

""almost one half of the forests that once covered the earth are now gone. groundwater sources are being depleted rapidly. biodiversity has been deeply eroded,"" it notes. as a result, ""planetary boundaries may well be surpassed, if current trends continue,"" cautions fao director-general josé graziano da silva in his introduction to the report. by 2050 humanity's ranks will likely have grown to nearly 10 billion people. in a scenario with moderate economic growth, this population increase will push up global demand for agricultural products by 50 percent over present levels projects the future of food and agriculture, intensifying pressures on already-strained natural resources. at the same time, greater numbers of people will be eating fewer cereals and larger amounts of meat, fruits, vegetables and processed food <U+0097> a result of an ongoing global dietary transition that will further add to those pressures, driving more deforestation, land degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. alongside these trends, the planet's changing climate will throw up additional hurdles. ""climate change will affect every aspect of food production,"" the report says. these include greater variability of precipitation and increases in the frequency of droughts and floods.to reach zero hunger, we need to step up our effortsthe core question raised by today's fao publication is whether, looking ahead, the world's agriculture and food systems are capable of sustainably meeting the needs of a burgeoning global population. the short answer? yes, the planet's food systems are capable of producing enough food to do so, and in a sustainable way, but unlocking that potential <U+0097> and ensuring that all of humanity benefits <U+0097> will require ""major transformations."" without a push to invest in and retool food systems, far too many people will still be hungry in 2030 <U+0097> the year by which the new sustainable development goals (sdg) agenda has targeted the eradication of chronic food insecurity and malnutrition, the report warns. ""without additional efforts to promote pro-poor development, reduce inequalities and protect vulnerable people, more than 600 million people would still be undernourished in 2030,"" it says. in fact, the current rate of progress would not even be enough to eradicate hunger by 2050.where will our food come from?given the limited scope for expanding agriculture's use of more land and water resources, the production increases needed to meet rising food demand will have to come mainly from improvements in productivity and resource-use efficiency. however there are worrying signs that yield growth is levelling off for major crops. since the 1990s, average increases in the yields of maize, rice, and wheat at the global level generally run just over 1 percent per annum, the report notes. to tackle these and the other challenges outlined in the report, ""business-as-usual"" is not an option, the future of food and agriculture argues.  ""major transformations in agricultural systems, rural economies and natural resource management will be needed if we are to meet the multiple challenges before us and realize the full potential of food and agriculture to ensure a secure and healthy future for all people and the entire planet,"" it says.  ""high-input, resource-intensive farming systems, which have caused massive deforestation, water scarcities, soil depletion and high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, cannot deliver sustainable food and agricultural production,"" adds the report.more with lessthe core challenge is to produce more with less, while preserving and enhancing the livelihoods of small-scale and family farmers, and ensuring access to food by the most vulnerable. for this, a twin-track approach is needed which combines investment in social protection, to immediately tackle undernourishment, and pro-poor investments in productive activities <U+0097>  especially agriculture and in rural economies <U+0097> to sustainably increase income-earning opportunities of the poor.  the world will need to shift to more sustainable food systems which make more efficient use of land, water and other inputs and sharply reduce their use of fossil fuels, leading to a drastic cut of agricultural green-house gas emissions, greater conservation of biodiversity, and a reduction of waste. this will necessitate more investment in agriculture and agrifood systems, as well as greater spending on research and development, the report says, to promote innovation, support sustainable production increases, and find better ways to cope with issues like water scarcity and climate change. along with boosting production and resilience, equally critical will be creating food supply chains that better connect farmers in low- and middle-income countries to urban markets <U+0097> along with measures which ensure access for consumers to nutritious and safe food at affordable prices, such as such as pricing policies and social protection programs, it says.   trends and challenges today's report identifies 15 trends and 10 challenges affecting the world's food systems:15 trendsa rapidly increasing world population marked by growth ""hot spots,"" urbanization, and agingdiverse trends in economic growth, family incomes, agricultural investment, and economic inequality.greatly increased competition for natural resourcesclimate changeplateauing agricultural productivitytransboundary diseasesincreased conflicts, crises and natural disasterspersistent poverty, inequality and food insecuritydietary transitions affecting nutrition and healthstructural changes in economic systems and employment implicationsincreased migrationchanging food systems and resulting impacts on farmers livelihoodspersisting food losses and wastenew international governance mechanisms for responding to food and nutrition security issueschanges in international financing for development.10 challengessustainably improving agricultural productivity to meet increasing demandensuring a sustainable natural resource baseaddressing climate change and intensification of natural hazardseradicating extreme poverty and reducing inequalityending hunger and all forms of malnutritionmaking food systems more efficient, inclusive and resilientimproving income earning opportunities in rural areas and addressing the root causes of migrationbuilding resilience to protracted crises, disasters and conflictspreventing transboundary and emerging agriculture and food system threatsaddressing the need for coherent and effective national and international governance",2021-04-16

""the plan is for the centres eventually to be independent of government support and external support,"" says kevin gallagher, former fao representative for sierra leone.

""it would be much more profitable."" fao is working closely with the government to make sure the existing centres are on a sound footing with strong management systems in place. the government's goal is then to strengthen and expand upon these activities <U+0097> a goal that got a boost from a recent $50 million grant from the global agriculture and food security program (gafsp), a multi-donor funding mechanism. <U+0091>our goal is to be self-reliant'the smallholder commercialisation programme, which is part of a 20-year national plan for sustainable agriculture development, is ambitious. and it's not without hurdles. sierra leone has made remarkable progress in the eight years since the end of the war, but it is still one of the poorest countries in the world. malnutrition and illiteracy rates are high, electricity is patchy and unemployment, especially among young people, is rife. ""the healthcare message was easier to get out,"" explains david mwesigwa, fao sierra leone emergency coordinator for the european union food facility, referring to the government's recent initiative to provide free health care to pregnant women and children.

""the pandemic has caused widespread upheaval in fisheries and aquaculture as production has been disrupted, supply chains have been interrupted and consumer spending restricted by various lockdowns,"" said fao deputy director-general, maria helena semedo. ""containment measures have provoked far-reaching changes, many of which are likely to persist in the long term.""  while food itself is not responsible for the transmission of covid-19 to people, the report stressed every stage of the fisheries and aquaculture supply chain is susceptible to being disrupted or stopped by containment restrictions. aggregate prices for 2020, as measured by the fish price index are down year-on-year for most traded species. restaurant and hotel closures in many countries have also led to a fall in demand for fresh fish products.  ""the impact has been significant in developing countries, especially those with large informal sectors, where small-scale and artisanal workers and communities depend on fisheries for their food security, livelihoods. they have borne the brunt of restrictions,"" semedo said.  the fao report indicated that in aquaculture there is growing evidence that unsold production will result in increasing levels of live fish stocks, creating higher costs for feeding as well as greater number of fish mortalities. sectors with longer production cycles, such as salmon, cannot adjust rapidly to the demand shifts.  global catches from wild fisheries are also expected to have declined slightly in 2020, as, overall, there has been a reduced fishing effort due to covid-19-related restrictions on fishing vessel crews and poor market conditions. as a result of covid-19, consumer preferences have shifted. while demand for fresh fish has waned, consumer demand for packaged and frozen products has grown as households look to stock up on non-perishable food. before the pandemic, the sector was on a general upwards trend. in 2018, global fisheries and aquaculture production (excluding aquatic plants) reached an all-time record of nearly 179 million tonnes. overall capture fisheries, with 96.4 million tonnes represented 54 percent of the total, while aquaculture, with 82.1 million tonnes, accounted for 46 percent. and over the last decades, fish consumption has grown significantly to an average of over 20 kilos per person.  fao has called for disruptive border restriction measures on trade in food to be minimized for food security. the report called for sectoral and regional organizations to work together in order to manage fisheries and aquaculture during the pandemic, with measures that support job protection and ensure a fast recovery of the sector without compromising sustainability. the impact of covid-19 on women, already vulnerable as food producers, processors, vendors and carers, should also be considered with government support provided for women along the fish value chain. uncertainty continues to dominate the outlook for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors, particularly with regard to the duration and severity of the pandemic.  this year cofi 34 is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the code of conduct for responsible fisheries, a landmark instrument endorsed by fao member states, that has been guiding efforts towards sustainable fisheries and aquaculture around the world. with the uncertainty in the sector posed by the pandemic and other issues, the code's principles have never been more vital to ensure the fisheries sector remains viable and sustainable.",2021-04-16

it will also indirectly benefit another 583 000 people.  relive has a total budget of $66.7 million, of which the green climate fund will provide $29.8 million. the remaining $36.84 million will be funded by the government of guatemala and the korea international cooperation agency, koica. the fao-supported relive project will be implemented by the ministry of agriculture and food (maga), the national forest institute (inab) and the german cooperation agency (giz). climate change mitigation and adaptation in sudan's gum arabic belt  the gums for adaptation and mitigation (gams) project in sudan is the first gcf funding proposal approved in what fao defines as the near east and north africa region. it aims to enhance rural smallholders' resilience to climate change in the states of north, west and south kordofan through climate-resilient gum agroforestry and rangeland restoration.  more specifically, the project will support the restoration of 75 000 hectares of smallholder gum agroforestry systems and 50 000 hectares of degraded lands while also improving smallholder gum value chains. offering a solid platform for the great green wall umbrella programme, the project will build on sudan's considerable experience in gum arabic production, which can be scaled up in other countries and adapted to different national contexts. the project will be implemented jointly by fao and the country's forest national corporation (fnc), in collaboration with the higher council for environment and natural resources. fao's work on climate change supporting countries' efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change is a cornerstone of fao's work. fao believes that the transition towards low-emission, sustainable food systems can be achieved through climate-smart approaches, practices and techniques that preserve the environment and biodiversity, and at the same time, help build the resilience of millions of poor family farmers.  through its work with the green climate fund, fao seeks to scale up climate investments in agriculture that offer socio-economic and environmental benefits that will support countries as they recover from the covid-19 pandemic and relaunch their economies on low-emission, climate-resilient development pathways.",2021-04-16
"63","Asia and the Pacific must increase food production to meet future demand","","10 march 2014, ulaanbaatar - governments in asia and the pacific should take some major, fundamental decisions <U+0096> and soon <U+0096> about ways to increase their food production and address undernourishment, fao has warned.the warning comes as nearly 40 fao member countries gathered in the mongolian capital for the 32nd fao regional conference for asia and the pacific to examine the state of food and agriculture in the region and a number of other important agriculture-related issues. while the asia-pacific region is making good progress in reducing undernutrition, it still has more hungry people than all the other regions of the world combined <U+0096> more than 550 million. the millennium development goal of reducing hunger by half by 2015 is on course to be met, and in southeastern asia has already been achieved. timor-leste has launched a national campaign to take forward the fight against hunger beyond 2015, inspired by the un<U+0092>s global zero hunger challenge (with a goal of 2025). however, the region as a whole needs to improve food production systems and delivery to consumers or face significant food security problems within the next generation. indeed some developing countries in asia and the pacific will need to increase their food production by up to 77 percent to feed their people by 2050, when the world<U+0092>s population is expected to top nine billion.asia and the pacific accounts for more than 90 percent of world rice production and consumption. the region<U+0092>s food security and people<U+0092>s livelihoods are very much dependent on rice. as a response to a request by fao member countries, fao has produced a regional rice strategy which is being discussed at the regional level for finalization.farming, fishing and forestry practices need to be modernized and made more profitable, while countries in the region must take serious, coordinated steps to reduce food losses and food waste, which is as high as 30-50 percent regarding grains, fruits and vegetables.accordingly, fao launched the regional save food asia-pacific campaign in august 2013 with an aim to promote public awareness of the need to minimize food losses and food waste.nutritional deficiencies a threat to health and economieswhile most people in this region are presently getting enough to eat, they are not eating the right foods. the result is a high rate of micro-nutrient deficiency <U+0096> a lack of absorption of minerals and vitamins. it can be devastating in childhood, where the result can leave a young person stunted, unable to fully reach his or her physical and mental development. in some developing countries in the region the affliction rate is as high as 50 percent. across the region there has been little progress in reducing vitamin a deficiency. between 1990 and 2007, there was only a five percent improvement <U+0096> from 37 percent to 32 percent <U+0096> a very slow rate of decline. meanwhile, in some countries rates of anemia can still be as high as 50 percent and iodine deficiency up to 30 percent. as the rate of obesity increases across asia and the pacific, other health problems are emerging such as cardiovascular disease, higher risk of stroke and diabetes. treating these conditions, especially in an aging population, will place a great burden on public health care systems across the region. between 1990 and 2010, the total disability-adjusted life years (dalys) lost to overweight and obesity in asia has more than doubled, while in pacific island countries it has quadrupled. these warnings and recommendations to member states for action are highlighted in an fao state of food and agriculture report to the regional conference.farming and fishing in asia and rethinking markets for pacific island countries  in many parts of the region, coconuts are both an important cash crop and one of the most important foods in the daily diet of millions. because of its economic importance, and because most coconut trees are aging, many 50-60 years old, there is a need to rehabilitate senile and unproductive palms in the coconut-growing countries in asia and the pacific. there is a strong business case to replant. coconuts offer value-added products like virgin coconut oil (vco), vco-based soap and cosmetic products that can provide additional and more stable income for coconut farmers.outside of traditional export commodities such as coffee, cocoa, round logs and copra, vertical integration into global value chains has not been well developed in pacific island countries (pics). the difficult economic geography of the pics, combined with robust competition from lower-cost countries in asia, suggests that pic agriculture might be usefully re-oriented towards the domestic market in order to improve food and nutrition security. increasing urbanization and a vibrant tourism sector is providing greater opportunities for pic farmers in domestic markets.aquaculture emerged as a significant source of fish and other aquatic animals in the mid-1980s, and it now provides at least half of the food fish consumed in the region. given the fact that fish is healthier than many meats, further rapid growth of aquaculture presents significant opportunities for improving food and nutrition security for the poor, provided it is undertaken sustainably. there are growing concerns about the intensification of aquaculture, however, in terms of both its sustainability and its environmental impact and these must be addressed before intensification.livestock production has been growing rapidly over the past 20 years, and fao projects that global demand for animal source food (asf) will increase by a further 76 percent from 2005/07 to 2050. but rapid growth of the livestock sector has led to many problems, including increased risks to human health from pathogens harboured by animals; environmental degradation, pollution and influx of high levels of drug residues into the environment; emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria because of the indiscriminate use of antibiotics; loss of biodiversity and genetic resources; and acceleration of climate change through livestock-associated emission of greenhouse gases.family farmingfamily farming is essential for the sustainability of agricultural, forestry and fishery production systems. such farms are the dominant mode of farm organization around the world, especially in asia and the pacific. in light of this importance, the general assembly of the united nations, at its 66th session, declared 2014 as the international year of family farming (iyff) and invited fao to facilitate its implementation in cooperation with governments, the united nations system and relevant non-governmental organizations. the overall objective of the iyff is to promote and help guide a broad discussion at national, regional and global levels to increase awareness and understanding about the diverse contributions, challenges and support needed for family farms and smallholder farming in eradicating hunger and reducing rural poverty, leading to sustainable development of rural areas and sustainable production aimed at achieving food security.fao organized a regional multi-stakeholder dialogue in november 2013 to kick-start a regional initiative to support the iyff. a regional conference on family farming in the 21st century: challenges and opportunities is being organized in chennai, india in august. regional perspectivesthe fao regional conference for asia and the pacific brings together ministers of agriculture and high-level officials of member states across the

""all of us - farmers and fishers; food processors and supermarkets; local and national governments; individual consumers -- must make changes at every link of the human food chain to prevent food wastage from happening in the first place, and re-use or recycle it when we can't,"" said fao director-general josé graziano da silva. ""we simply cannot allow one-third of all the food we produce to go to waste or be lost because of inappropriate practices, when 870 million people go hungry every day,"" he added. as a companion to its new study, fao has also published a comprehensive ""tool-kit"" that contains recommendations on how food loss and waste can be reduced at every stage of the food chain. the tool-kit profiles a number of projects around the world that show how national and local governments, farmers, businesses, and individual consumers can take steps to tackle the problem.achim steiner, un environment programme (unep) executive director, said: ""unep and fao have identified food waste and loss --food wastage-- as a major opportunity for economies everywhere to assist in a transition towards a low carbon, resource efficient and inclusive green economy. today's excellent report by fao underlines the multiple benefits that can be realized-- in many cases through simple and thoughtful measures by for example households, retailers, restaurants, schools and businesses-- that can contribute to environmental sustainability, economic improvements, food security and the realization of the un secretary general's zero hunger challenge. we would urge everyone to adopt the motto of our joint campaign: think eat save - reduce your foodprint!"".  unep and fao are founding partners of the think eat save - reduce your foodprint campaign that was launched earlier in the year and whose aim is to assist in coordinating worldwide efforts to manage down wastage. where wastage happensfifty-four percent of the world's food wastage occurs ""upstream"" during production, post-harvest handling and storage, according to fao's study. forty-six percent of it happens ""downstream,"" at the processing, distribution and consumption stages. as a general trend, developing countries suffer more food losses during agricultural production, while food waste at the retail and consumer level tends to be higher in middle- and high-income regions -- where it accounts for 31-39 percent of total wastage -- than in low-income regions (4-16 percent). the later a food product is lost along the chain, the greater the environmental consequences, fao's report notes, since the environmental costs incurred during processing, transport, storage and cooking must be added to the initial production costs.hot spotsseveral world food wastage ""hot-spots"" stand out in the study: wastage of cereals in asia is a significant problem, with major impacts on carbon emissions and water and land use. rice's profile is particularly noticeable, given its high methane emissions combined with a large level of wastage.  while meat wastage volumes in all world regions is comparatively low, the meat sector generates a substantial impact on the environment in terms of land occupation and carbon footprint, especially in high-income countries and latin america, which in combination account for 80 percent of all meat wastage. excluding latin america, high-income regions are responsible for about 67 percent of all meat wastage fruit wastage contributes significantly to water waste in asia, latin america, and europe, mainly as a result of extremely high wastage levels. similarly, large volumes of vegetable wastage in industrialized asia, europe, and south and south east asia translates into a large carbon footprint for that sector.causes of food wastage - and options for addressing them a combination of consumer behavior and lack of communication in the supply chain underlies the higher levels of food waste in affluent societies, according to fao. consumers fail to plan their shopping, overpurchase, or over-react to ""best-before-dates,"" while quality and aesthetic standards lead retailers to reject large amounts of perfectly edible food. in developing countries, significant post-harvest losses in the early part of the supply chain are a key problem, occurring as a result of financial and structural limitations in harvesting techniques and storage and transport infrastructure, combined with climatic conditions favorable to food spoilage. to tackle the problem, fao's toolkit details three general levels where action is needed: high priority should be given to reducing food wastage in the first place. beyond improving losses of crops on farms due to poor practices, doing more to better balance production with demand would mean not using natural resources to produce unneeded food in the first place. in the event of a food surplus, re-use within the human food chain-- finding secondary markets or donating extra food to feed vulnerable members of society-- represents the best option. if the food is not fit for human consumption, the next best option is to divert it for livestock feed, conserving resources that would otherwise be used to produce commercial feedstuff. where re-use is not possible, recycling and recovery should be pursued: by-product recycling, anaerobic digestion, compositing, and incineration with energy recovery allow energy and nutrients to be recovered from food waste, representing a significant advantage over dumping it in landfills. uneaten food that ends up rotting in landfills is a large producer of methane, a particularly harmful ghg.  funding for the food wastage footprint report and toolkit was provided by the government of germany.read in more detail about fao's specific recommendations for reducing food wastage.",2021-04-16

""now they are on the frontline and bearing the brunt of covid-19's disruptive effects on food systems, which are fuelling a hunger crisis within a health crisis,"" he said, adding: ""we must not think of this as a risk that will emerge sometime down the line.  we cannot treat this as tomorrow's problem. we need to do more to safeguard both food systems and our most vulnerable populations - right now.""  four ways covid-19 is pushing up acute food insecurity fao and wfp say that there are four main ways that covid-19 is pushing people into deeper hunger:  dropping employment and wages means that people have less money to spend on household food and that overseas workers send to relatives in food insecure countries as remittances. at the same time, food prices are up in many hotspot countries, posing a barrier to food access. a range of disruptions associated with necessary pandemic and health countermeasures are also having significant - and increasing - impacts on food production and supply. plummeting government revenues mean that critical safety nets such as social protection and school feeding programs are underfunded and unable to respond to growing needs. finally, the pandemic may contribute to political instability as well as fuelling conflict, for example between communities over natural resources like water or grazing land or migration routes, which further disrupts agricultural production and markets.emerging evidence from ongoing fao surveys in countries with food crises contexts back up today's joint analysis, indicating that food production is emerging as a serious challenge. surveyed farmers are reporting numerous challenges in accessing seeds, resulting in reduced planting. in haiti, 90 percent of interviewees expect to see a significant decrease in cereal production. in colombia, over half of livestock keepers questioned report difficulties in accessing feed, while in south sudan, two-thirds of respondents say they are struggling to access animal health support. this dynamic is likely to lead to a vicious cycle of declining production, reduced agricultural labour opportunities and increasing food prices, resulting in negative coping strategies and a further deterioration of food and nutrition security. anticipate, rather than react in a bid to counter these trends, fao today released a revised appeal for $428.5 million under the un system's global humanitarian response plan for covid-19 that addresses the mounting needs in the food and agriculture sector, focusing on urgent livelihoods assistance to safeguard livelihoods, maintaining food chains and ensuring the most vulnerable people can access and produce vital, nutritious food, as also on on data collection and analysis that can inform interventions. responding to the challenges requires scaled-up urgent action, according to fao. critical agricultural seasons, livestock movements for pasture and water, food harvesting, processing and storage are not activities that can be put on hold.  ""if we act now and at scale,  we can keep as many people as possible producing food, safeguard their livelihoods and reduce their need for humanitarian food assistance, while laying the foundations for a resilient recovery,"" said fao's qu, adding: ""it is not too late to prevent the worst hunger crisis in generations."" also in response to growing humanitarian needs in the food and agriculture sector, last week fao's governing council approved the director-general's proposal to establish a new office on resilience and emergencies that aims to significantly expand the organization's capacity to rapidly respond to humanitarian crises and save livelihoods to save lives.today's report is part of a series of analytical products produced under the global network against food crisesinitiative co-led by eu, fao and wfp to enhance and coordinate the generation and sharing of evidence-based information and analysis for preventing and addressing food crises""   note to editors: examples from hunger hotspots in afghanistan, food price has increased of up to 20 percent, according to today's report, while the pandemic has also caused reduced incomes, disrupted food supply chains, and reduced and access issues to agricultural inputs, fuel and labour. in bangladesh, the economic impact of the crisis is poised to double the country's poverty rate, pushing it to over 40 percent. in ethiopia, covid-19-related mitigation measures, in combination with recent flooding and crop losses caused by desert locusts, will likely result in a below-average secondary season belg harvest gathered in june-july in haiti, covid-19 impacts come on top of poor and erratic precipitation during the just ended main rainy season, with likely drops in agricultural production and resulting in crop losses -- for another consecutive year. in sierra leone prices of major food commodities have already risen well above their long-term average and a potential reduction in domestic agricultural production, resulting from a below-average rainfall forecast for the coming season, could lead to further food price increases.  in somalia, covid-19 challenges, in combination with recent flooding and desert locust impacts, are projected to drive down the output of the main gu season crops, to be harvested in july, by 20-30 percent. livestock exports - a massive source of export impact - are already down by 20 percent and another reduction of 30-50 percent is expected due to reduced demand from saudi arabia, following the cancellation of the pilgrimage during ramadan. the number of people in somalia experiencing acute hunger is projected to triple over last year. in yemen, already the world's largest food and humanitarian crisis, a 35 percent increase in food prices has been recorded in some areas since april zimbabwe already endured one of the driest seasons on record, leading to significant cereal deficits for a second year in a row. now, the economic impact of the pandemic is already observed through further currency depreciation, inflation (with food inflation standing at 953.5 percent as of may 2020, an increase from 685% in january 2020).",2021-04-16

(additional facts from fao's report) to arrive at its estimates, fao conducted a detailed analysis of ghg emissions at multiple stages of various livestock supply chains, including the production and transport of animal feed, on-farm energy use, emissions from animal digestion and manure decay, as well as post-slaughter transport, refrigeration and packaging of animal products (more about fao's methodology).large potential for cuts by drilling down into where and how emissions occur, the report reveals that significant emission reductions are within the reach of livestock producers. wider adoption of existing best practices and technologies in feeding, health and husbandry, and manure management <U+0096> as well as greater use of currently underutilized technologies such as biogas generators and energy-saving devices <U+0096> could help the global livestock sector cut its outputs of global warming gases as much as 30 percent by becoming more efficient and reducing energy waste. within livestock production systems, there is a strong link between resource use efficiency and the intensity of ghg emissions, notes fao's report. the potential for achieving emissions reductions lies in enabling all livestock producers to change to practices already being used by the most efficient operators. (livestock production practices that can help reduce ghg emissions)              ""these new findings show that the potential to improve the sector's environmental performance is significant <U+0096> and that realizing that potential is indeed do-able,"" said ren wang, fao assistant director-general for agriculture and consumer protection. ""these efficiency gains can be achieved by improving practices, and don't necessitate changing production systems. but we need political will, better policies and most importantly, joint action."" with world demand for livestock products continuing to grow strongly in almost all developing countries, he added, ""it is imperative that the sector starts working now to achieve these reductions, to help offset the increases in overall emissions that future growth in livestock production will entail."" many of the actions fao recommends for improving efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions would also boost production <U+0096> providing people with more food and higher incomes, with benefits for food security and poverty reduction. currently, livestock raising supports the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people and represents an increasingly important source of protein in many regions that have long struggled with chronic hunger and malnutrition.potential across the board substantial emission reductions can be achieved across all species, systems and regions, fao's report argues, with the greatest potential for cuts found in low productivity ruminant livestock systems in south asia, latin america and africa (definitions). however in developed countries <U+0096> where emission intensities are relatively low but the overall volume of production and therefore emissions is high <U+0096> even small decreases in intensity could still add up to significant gains. this is the case for example for dairy farming in europe and north america, and for pork raising in east asia. cattle-raising contributes 65 percent of the livestock sector's total ghg emissions, but also offers the largest potential for reductions. making the change enabling the livestock production sector <U+0096> a diverse, globe-spanning activity which varies greatly from country to country <U+0096> become more efficient and reduce emissions will require a mix of policies, incentives, and on-the-ground work, fao says. there needs to be a focus on practice innovation, supported by knowledge transfer, financial incentives, regulations, and awareness raising. particularly important, better policies are needed to facilitate the transfer and use of efficient practices and technologies already adopted by a minority of producers and to encourage the development of new solutions.  using a ""life-cycle"" approach can help policymakers target emission hot spots along the livestock sectors supply chains, identifying clear opportunities for cuts and facilitating situation-tailored actions. financial incentives are also key, as practice change may involve risks and require initial investments. to ensure participation by developing countries <U+0096> where much of the sector's mitigation potential is found <U+0096> responses will need to target not just mitigation goals but also development objectives. the development of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (namas) for the livestock sector can help integrate these objectives at the national level.  international efforts should be pursued to ensure that mitigation commitments, both within and outside the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc), are strengthened to provide stronger incentives to mitigate livestock sector emissions and ensure that the effort is balanced throughout different sectors of the economy.  and any effort to put the livestock sector on an alternative track will require a broad-based and inclusive mutual effort.

moderator stephen sackur asked qu, as he questioned the multiple nature of priorities for systemic change. <U+0093>rich nations, start by eliminating food waste,<U+0094> the director-general replied. that would demand no investment <U+0096> but rather, a decisive shift in consumption patterns. poorer nations, for their part, should avoid the mistake of their richer counterparts and opt for less intensive energy use to develop their economies, he said. collectively, qu agreed, we must tackle the contribution of agri-food systems to greenhouse gas emissions, which fao estimates at over a third of the total. yet while some agricultural sectors were indeed heavy emitters, he noted, others, such as forestry, were the opposite. <U+0093>break down each crop, each commodity, and make it carbon-neutral,<U+0094> qu urged, once more advocating a targeted scientific approach. still: was there the level of international cooperation required? sackur asked, as he pointed to competition for vaccines amid the current pandemic. was there the common will? <U+0093>in my time at fao,<U+0094> qu replied, <U+0093>i have had nothing but support from the eu, an fao member for 30 years; from the g20; the g7; from the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) <U+0096> and, indeed, from the holy father.<U+0094> he offered fao<U+0092>s hand-in-hand initiative, which he launched immediately after assuming office, as an example of how countries rich and poor could be brought together. we had to start with the most vulnerable, qu said, with the initiative targeting 50 or so nations. among them, many small island or landlocked developing countries, match-making with donors <U+0096> including middle-income countries such as china, thailand or turkey <U+0096> who could share expertise and experience. <U+0093>passion breeds solidarity,<U+0094> the fao director-general concluded, as the moderator welcomed his <U+0093>compelling, upbeat intervention<U+0094>.",2021-04-16

(read fao's report on the data)  sources of agricultural emissions the largest source of ghg emissions within agriculture is enteric fermentation - when methane is produced by livestock during digestion and released via belches - this accounted in 2011 for 39 percent of the sector's total ghg outputs. emissions from enteric fermentation increased 11 percent between 2001 and 2011.  emissions generated during the application of synthetic fertilizers accounted for 13 percent of agricultural emissions (725 mt co2 eq.) in 2011, and are the fastest growing emissions source in agriculture, having increased some 37 percent since 2001. greenhouse gases resulting from biological processes in rice paddies that generate methane make up 10 percent of total agricultural emissions, while the burning of savannahs accounts for 5 percent.  in 2011,  44 percent of agriculture-related ghg outputs occurred in asia, followed by the americas (25%), africa (15%),  europe (12%), and oceania (4%), according to fao's data. this regional distribution was fairly constant over the last decade. in 1990 however, asia's contribution to the global total (38%) was smaller than at present, while europe's was much larger (21%).figures for energy use the new fao data also provide a detailed view of emissions from energy use in the agriculture sector generated from traditional fuel sources, including electricity and fossil fuels burned to power agricultural machinery, irrigation pumps and fishing vessels.  these emissions exceeded 785 million tonnes of co2 eq. in 2010, having increased by 75 percent since 1990.better data means better responses designing responses will require detailed assessments of both emission data and mitigation options. for instance, fao is already generating disaggregated assessments along supply chains and analyzing the effectiveness of comprehensive mitigation interventions in the livestock sector.  ""fao's new data represent the most comprehensive source of information on agriculture's contribution to global warming made to date,"" said francesco tubiello of the organization's climate, energy and tenure division. ""up to now, information gaps have made it extremely difficult for scientists and policymakers to make strategic decisions regarding how to respond to climate change and has hampered efforts to mitigate agriculture's emissions."" <U+0091>'data on emissions for afolu activities support member countries in better identifying their mitigation options and enable their farmers to take faster and more targeted climate-smart responses. this in turn improves their overall resilience and their food security. it also allows the countries to tap into international climate funding and accomplish their rural development goals. we also see much interest in capacity development on these topics at country level and respond to these needs through regional and country-level activities around the globe,'' he added. contribution to ipcc reporting and fao activities launched in 2012, the faostat emissions database has been for the first time a key source of ghg emissions data analysis of agriculture, forestry and other land use activities for the fifth ippc assessment report, which is currently undergoing finalization. data updates and enhancements like those released today will be made annually. the faostat emissions database was developed with financial support from the governments of germany and norway.* carbon dioxide equivalents, or co2 eq, is a metric used to compare emissions from different greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential.",2021-04-16

""the issue of governance is central. identifying and defining the appropriate role of government, in its broadest sense, is the cornerstone on which future development of the livestock sector must build.""efforts are needed to ensure that this rapidly growing sector contributes fully to food security and poverty reduction, moving towards a <U+0091>more responsible livestock sector', diouf said.driving forcethe livestock sector is one of the fastest growing parts of the agricultural economy, the fao report underlines. livestock contributes 40 percent of the global value of agricultural production and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost one billion people. globally, livestock contributes 15 percent of total food energy and 25 percent of dietary protein. products from livestock provide essential micronutrients that are not easily obtained from other plant food products.rising incomes, population growth and urbanization are the driving forces behind a growing demand for meat products in developing countries<U+0097>and they will continue to be important. to meet rising demand, global annual meat production is expected to expand from 228 currently to 463 million tonnes by 2050 with the cattle population estimated to grow from 1.5 billion to 2.6 billion and that of goats and sheep from 1.7 billion to 2.7 billion, according to fao estimates.livelihoodsstrong demand for animal food products offers significant opportunities for livestock to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. but many smallholders are facing several challenges in remaining competitive with larger, more intensive production systems. the report warns that ""a widening gulf is emerging between those who can take advantage of growing demand for livestock products and those who cannot.""fao recommends that smallholders should be supported in taking advantage of the opportunities provided by an expanding livestock sector and in managing the risks associated with increasing competition. broader rural development strategies creating off-farm jobs should help those that may be unable to adapt and compete in a rapidly modernizing sector. ""policy makers also need to recognize and protect livestock's safety-net function for the very poor,"" according to sofa.environmentthere is a need to enhance the efficiency of natural-resource use in the sector and to reduce the environmental footprint of livestock production, the report says. the goal is to ensure that continued growth in livestock production does not create undue pressure on ecosystems, biodiversity, land and forest resources and water quality and does not contribute to global warming. while some countries have made progress in reducing pollution and deforestation associated with livestock production, many more require appropriate policies and enforcement capacity. market-based policies, such as taxes and fees for natural-resource use or payments for environmental services, would encourage producers to ensure that livestock production is carried out in a sustainable way.livestock can play an important role in both adapting to climate change and mitigating its effects on human welfare, fao said. to realize the sector's potential to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation based on enhanced capacities to monitor, report and verify emissions from the livestock production new technologies will need to be developed.healthanimal diseases pose systemic risks that must be addressed, fao said. since new pathogenic agents will continue to emerge, investments in national animal-health and food safety infrastructure are required to reduce the risks of animal diseases to humans. poor livestock keepers need to be more engaged in disease-control efforts.",2021-04-16

were an affordable source of safe and nutritious food, high in protein, fibre, vitamins and micronutrients; and could fix atmospheric nitrogen, release high-quality organic matter in the soil and facilitate soil nutrients' circulation and water retention.""less fertilizers, a smaller water footprint and reduced use of energy, means lower greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said.the director-general also pointed out that pulses had a higher cost-benefit ratio than other staples, which helped diversify and improve the income of rural people, often women and youth, and located in vulnerable regions.""pulses have a long shelf life. shifting consumption patterns to more pulses could, therefore, contribute to reducing food waste,"" he said, noting that this characteristic has proved useful during the covid-19 pandemic, as people without access to fresh food could still consume pulses.qu also reiterated fao's commitment to supporting its members to increase the production and consumption of pulses, noting the importance of consumption as the true engine of transformation.in support of pulsespope francis - in a message delivered by the permanent observer of the holy see to fao, monseigneur fernando chica arellano - said that pulses were a noble food, with a huge potential to bolster food security globally. pulses are a simple and nutritious food that overcome geographical barriers and go beyond social classes and cultures, he noted.pope francis also deplored the fact that many people, including children, didn't have healthy or sufficient food, and stressed that the consumption of healthy diets should be a universal right, with states having to play a key role in making this a reality.argentina's minister for agriculture, livestock and fisheries, luis eugenio basterra, extolled the many virtues of pulses, including their being an excellent crop in dry environments where food production was difficult due to the scarcity of water, and especially for vulnerable populations with little or no access to technology, for whom access to food represented a true challenge.china is the world's fourth largest producer of pulses. china's minister for agriculture and rural affairs, renjian tang - in his message delivered by niu dun, china's ambassador and permanent representative to fao - put forward solutions to promoting the sustainable development of the world's pulses industry by: bolstering efforts to increase pulses' consumption; increasing the supply of pulses through production expansion, scientific and technological innovation; and establishing a global common market for pulses.narendra singh tomar, india's minister for agriculture and farmers' welfare, said that pulses were especially important in a country such as india where the population was mostly vegetarian and considered pulses a major food item. he noted that his country had achieved near self-sufficiency in pulses production, and was the world's largest producer and consumer of pulses, producing nearly a quarter of the world's pulses.france is the largest producer of pulses in the european union. france's minister for agriculture and food, julien denormandie, said that protein crops, especially pulses, were the crops of the future. he noted that france's objective was to increase areas planted with pulses by 40 percent over the next three years, and to boost the consumption of pulses, including through the school meals programme.burkina faso played a leading role in the designation of world pulses day. the ambassador and permanent representative of burkina faso to fao, jose´phine ouedraogo, highlighted the key role of women in the production, processing and distribution of pulses in local markets. the ambassador and permanent representative of argentina to fao, carlos bernardo cherniak, agreed, noting that pulse production initiatives contributed to the empowerment of rural and indigenous women.the president of cuatro pinos - a cooperative of indigenous women in guatemala - sandra xiquin emphasized that pulses such as beans were important to the people of her country; however, the tradition of cooking and consuming pulses was no longer as strong as it used to be and it was important for this tradition to be restored. the un food systems summit 2021 special envoy, agnes kalibata, said that pulses provided a potential answer to several questions regarding how to ""recover better"" after covid-19. kalibata also encouraged everyone at the event to get their ideas on the table, including elevating the role of pulses in food systems, and to participate in the food systems dialogues.the president of the global pulse confederation 2021, cindy brown, noted that, globally, there had been an increase of about nine percent in the consumption of pulses over this past year of the pandemic - more than double the increase in consumption that was estimated to result from the successful 2016 international year of pulses.  the world trade organization counsellor, diwakar dixit, pointed out that the global production of pulses had grown by over 50 percent in the last 20 years, with developing countries playing an important role. global pulses trade has grown two times faster than growth in production with some of the poorest countries on the planet being amongst the top exporters of pulses, he said.the fao deputy director-general beth bechdol closed the event, reiterating pulses' essential role in achieving the sustainable development goals.the event was moderated by alex jones, fao's director of resource mobilization and private sector partnerships division.about world pulses daythis year's world pulses day theme is love pulses - for a healthy diet and planet.the united nations general assembly in 2018 first designated 10 february as world pulses day and fao as the lead agency for the day, following the success of the 2016 international year of pulses led by fao.",2021-04-16

""recently we have started focusing on nutrition issues more, addressing increasingly the negative effects of obesity and overweight including impacts of food systems on non-communicable diseases,"" he added. rakhmanin, also expressed his gratitude to fao's partners in the region for their active support, including the european union and turkey - in particular for their role in providing accommodation for syrian refugees - the russian federation and china. he noted that the latter, though outside the region, is ""actively engaged in projects in central asia, the caucuses and the balkans."" obesity and micronutrient deficiencies - a serious concern for europe and central asia dr. mirjana gurinovic, senior researcher from the serbia's centre of research excellence in nutrition and metabolism institute, gave an insight into the dynamics of all three components of malnutrition in the region.  ""malnutrition is a major obstacle to socio-economic development in many countries due to its impact on health and population with high social and public costs,"" she said. she noted that undernutrition has been decreasing in the last decade in europe and central asia but is now stagnating at 6.2 percent from 2017. ""on the other hand we have micronutrient deficiencies - so called ""hidden hunger""- with the highest prevalence of iron deficiencies causing anemia,"" gurinovic said, noting that anemia among women have already reached 38 percent in the caucasus and in central asia.    in her presentation, she also highlighted the increasing threat of obesity looming over the region with around 25 percent of the population suffering from this fast growing epidemic.  in the caucasus and central asia, we have witnessed the highest growth rate of obesity for the last two decades, she said, the obesity prevalence grew by 40 percent in these countries from 2000 to 2016. ""if you look at the total population, the western balkans and turkey are leading in the rates of obesity,"" she added. tackling hunger, poverty and malnutrition in tajikistan the deputy minister for agriculture of tajikistan nusratulo musoev shared his country's experience in tackling hunger, poverty and malnutrition.  ""with the fao's support, the government of tajikistan is developing programmes aimed at channeling the remittances of migrants towards agricultural development in the country,"" he said, noting that remittances make a substantial contribution to the national economy accounting for 30 percent of the country's gdp. ""more than half of the households in tajikistan receive remittances, which are a significant part of their revenues ranging from 50 to 60 percent. these remittances are becoming an important and stable source of income for many households allowing them to overcome poverty,"" the deputy minister said. he also noted that the government of tajikistan and fao are supporting a more rational use of remittances by investing money in the development of family farms as opposed to being fully spent on households' daily needs. musoev also highlighted the importance of school feeding programmes. ""with the support of fao, the government of tajikistan is working on the implementation of a school feeding nutrition development programme aimed at enhancing access of children to healthy and diverse diets while at the same time promoting the development of local agricultural production in schools,"" he said. the deputy minister noted that under the project 20 selected schools have established 22 greenhouses using drip irrigation, which made it possible to improve the diets of 3400 students. rakhmanin concluded by saying: ""we need to continue contributing to the rural development but also safeguarding biodiversity, promoting agroecology, preventing antimicrobial resistance and tackling transboundary animal diseases,"" and pointed to the region's wealth of nutrient-rich diets, ""which we can introduce to the world."" he also urged greater cooperation between countries and the sharing of best practices.",2021-04-16

""a well-functioning, predictable international trade system can help ensure global food security and allow producers in exporting countries to thrive,"" mr gurría said. ""experience has shown that trade restrictions are no recipe for food security."" fao director-general qu said: ""we need better policies, more innovation, increased investments and greater inclusiveness to build dynamic, productive and resilient agricultural and food sectors.""  about 85 percent of global crop output growth over the next decade is expected to come from yield improvements resulting from higher input use, investments in production technology and better cultivation practices. multiple harvests per year will account for another 10 percent of crop output growth, leaving only 5 percent to cropland expansion. by 2024, aquaculture production is projected to overtake capture fisheries as the most important source of fish worldwide. global livestock production is expected to expand by 14 percent, faster than the projected increase in animal numbers. feed use will expand in line with aquaculture and livestock production as feed efficiency improvements will be counterbalanced by an increase in feed intensity due to reduced backyard farming. the outlook underscores the continuing need to invest in building productive, resilient and sustainable food systems in the face of uncertainties. beyond covid-19, current challenges include the locust invasion in east africa and asia, the continued spread of african swine fever, more frequent extreme climatic events, and trade tensions among major trading powers. the food system will also need to adapt to evolving diets and consumer preferences and take advantage of digital innovations in agro-food supply chains. innovation will remain critical in improving the resilience of food systems in the face of multiple challenges.  assuming the continuation of current policies and technologies, agricultural greenhouse gas emissions are projected to grow by 0.5 percent annually, indicating a reduction in agriculture's carbon intensity. livestock will account for 80 percent of this global increase. nevertheless, without additional efforts, this slowdown will still fall short of what the agricultural sector could and should do to contribute to the paris agreement targets for fighting climate change. +++++ the oecd-fao agricultural outlook 2020-2029 provides evidence-based inputs to support policy makers in the development of a resilient global food system to address the long-term challenges of food security, climate change, rural livelihoods and global resource use. the agricultural outlook is a collaborative effort of the oecd (organisation for economic co-operation and development) and fao (food and agriculture organization of the united nations), prepared with input from experts in their member governments and specialist commodity organisations. it provides a consensus assessment of the ten-year prospects for agricultural and fish commodity markets at national, regional and global levels. +++++",2021-04-16

warns fao<U+0092>s state of the world<U+0092>s biodiversity for food and agriculture report, launched today, biodiversity for food and agriculture <U+0096> i.e. all the species that support our food systems and sustain the people who grow and/or provide our food <U+0096> cannot be recovered.biodiversity for food and agriculture is all the plants and animals - wild and domesticated - that provide food, feed, fuel and fibre. it is also the myriad of organisms that support food production through ecosystem services <U+0096> called <U+0093>associated biodiversity<U+0094>. this includes all the plants, animals and micro-organisms (such as insects, bats, birds, mangroves, corals, seagrasses, earthworms, soil-dwelling fungi and bacteria) that keep soils fertile, pollinate plants, purify water and air, keep fish and trees healthy, and fight crop and livestock pests and diseases.the report, prepared by fao under the guidance of the commission on genetic resources for food and agriculture looks at all these elements. it is based on information provided specifically for this report by 91 countries, and the analysis of the latest global data. <U+0093>biodiversity is critical for safeguarding global food security, underpinning healthy and nutritious diets, improving rural livelihoods, and enhancing the resilience of people and communities. we need to use biodiversity in a sustainable way, so that we can better respond to rising climate change challenges and produce food in a way that doesn<U+0092>t harm our environment,<U+0094> said fao<U+0092>s director-general josé graziano da silva. <U+0093>less biodiversity means that plants and animals are more vulnerable to pests and diseases. compounded by our reliance on fewer and fewer species to feed ourselves, the increasing loss of biodiversity for food and agriculture puts food security and nutrition at risk,<U+0094> added graziano da silva. the foundation of our food systems is under severe threatthe report points to decreasing plant diversity in farmers<U+0092> fields, rising numbers of livestock breeds at risk of extinction and increases in the proportion of overfished fish stocks.of some 6,000 plant species cultivated for food, fewer than 200 contribute substantially to global food output, and only nine account for 66 percent of total crop production.the world<U+0092>s livestock production is based on about 40 animal species, with only a handful providing the vast majority of meat, milk and eggs. of the 7,745 local (occurring in one country) breeds of livestock reported globally, 26 percent are at risk of extinction. nearly a third of fish stocks are overfished, more than half have reached their sustainable limit.information from the 91 reporting countries reveals that wild food species and many species that contribute to ecosystem services that are vital to food and agriculture, including pollinators, soil organisms and natural enemies of pests, are rapidly disappearing. for example, countries report that 24 percent of nearly 4,000 wild food species <U+0096> mainly plants, fish and mammals - are decreasing in abundance. but the proportion of wild foods in decline is likely to be even greater as the state of more than half of the reported wild food species is unknown. the largest number of wild food species in decline appear in countries in latin america and the caribbean, followed by asia-pacific and africa. this could be, however, a result of wild food species being more studied and/or reported on in these countries than in others.many associated biodiversity species are also under severe threat. these include birds, bats and insects that help control pests and diseases, soil biodiversity, and wild pollinators <U+0096> such as bees, butterflies, bats and birds. forests, rangelands, mangroves, seagrass meadows, coral reefs and wetlands in general <U+0096> key ecosystems that deliver numerous services essential to food and agriculture and are home to countless species <U+0096> are also rapidly declining. leading causes of biodiversity loss the driver of biodiversity for food and agriculture loss cited by most reporting countries is: changes in land and water use and management, followed by pollution, overexploitation and overharvesting, climate change, and population growth and urbanization. in the case of associated biodiversity, while all regions report habitat alteration and loss as major threats, other key drivers vary across regions. these are overexploitation, hunting and poaching in africa; deforestation, changes in land use and intensified agriculture in europe and central asia; overexploitation, pests, diseases and invasive species in latin america and the caribbean; overexploitation in the near east and north africa, and deforestation in asia. biodiversity-friendly practices are on the rise the report highlights a growing interest in biodiversity-friendly practices and approaches. eighty percent of the 91 countries indicate using one or more biodiversity-friendly practices and approaches such as: organic agriculture, integrated pest management, conservation agriculture, sustainable soil management, agroecology, sustainable forest management, agroforestry, diversification practices in aquaculture, ecosystem approach to fisheries and ecosystem restoration.conservation efforts, both on-site (e.g. protected areas, on farm management) and off-site (e.g. gene banks, zoos, culture collections, botanic gardens) are also increasing globally, although levels of coverage and protection are often inadequate. reversing trends that lead to biodiversity loss <U+0096> what is neededwhile the rise in biodiversity-friendly practices is encouraging, more needs to be done to stop the loss of biodiversity for food and agriculture.most countries have put in place legal, policy and institutional frameworks for the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity, but these are often inadequate or insufficient. the report calls on governments and the international community to do more to strengthen enabling frameworks, create incentives and benefit-sharing measures, promote pro-biodiversity initiatives and address the core drivers of biodiversity loss. greater efforts must also be made to improve the state of knowledge of biodiversity for food and agriculture as many information gaps remain, particularly for associated biodiversity species. many such species have never been identified and described, particularly invertebrates and micro-organisms. over 99 percent of bacteria and protist species <U+0096> and their impact on food and agriculture <U+0096> remain unknown. there is a need to improve collaboration among policy-makers, producer organizations, consumers, the private sector and civil-society organizations across food and agriculture and environment sectors.opportunities to develop more markets for biodiversity-friendly products could be explored more. the report also highlights the role the general public can play in reducing pressures on biodiversity for food and agriculture. consumers may be able to opt for sustainably grown products, buy from farmers<U+0092> markets, or boycott foods seen as unsustainable. in several countries, <U+0093>citizen scientists<U+0094> play an important role in monitoring biodiversity for food and agriculture.  examples: impacts of biodiversity loss and biodiversity-friendly practices  in the gambia, massive losses of wild foods have forced communities to turn to alternatives, often industrially produced foods, to supplement their diets.  in egypt, rising temperatures will lead to northwards shifts in ranges of fish species, with impacts on fishery production.labour shortages, flows of remittances and increasing availability of cheap alternative products on local markets have contributed to local crops abandonment in nepal.in the amazonian forests of peru, climatic changes are predicted to lead to <U+0093>savannization<U+0094>, with negative impacts on wild foods<U+0092> supply.californian farmers allow their rice fields to flood in winter instead of burning them after growing season. this provides 111,000 hectares of wetlands and open space for 230 bird species, many at risk of extinction. as a result, many species have begun to increase in numbers, and the number of ducks has doubled.in france, about 300,000 hectares of land are managed using agroecological principles. in kiribati, integrated farming of milkfish, sandfish, sea cucumber and seaweed ensures regular food and income as despite changing weather conditions, at least one component of the system is always producing food.",2021-04-16

at the global event marking today the first international day of awareness of food loss and waste, the un food and agriculture organization (fao), the un environment programme (unep) and their partners urged everyone to do more to reduce food loss and waste or risk an even greater drop in food security and natural resources.some 690 million people today are hungry and three billion cannot afford a healthy diet. hunger has been on the rise for the past five years, and the covid-19 pandemic is threatening the food and nutrition security of up to an additional 132 million of people. on top of that, we are faced with an ecosystem decline and the consequences of climate change.yet, food continues to be lost and wasted. this year we have witnessed an increase in food loss and waste as a result of movement and transport restrictions due to the pandemic.covid-19 aside, however, each year about 14 percent of the world's food is lost before even reaching the market. food loss is valued at $400 billion annually - about the gdp of austria. on top of this comes food waste, for which new estimates are coming out early 2021. when it comes to environmental impact, food loss and waste generate eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.food loss occurs from farm up to and excluding retail, whilst food waste occurs at retail, food service and household level. causes range from poor handling, inadequate transport or storage, lack of cold chain capacity, extreme weather conditions to cosmetic standards, and a lack of planning and cooking skills among consumers.simply put, reducing food lost or wasted means more food for all, less greenhouse gas emissions, less pressure on the environment, and increased productivity and economic growth.  innovation, technologies and behavioral change - key to reducing food loss and waste""food loss and waste is a big challenge of our time,"" said fao director-general qu dongyu, urging for stronger partnerships, more public and private investments in training for smallholder farmers, technology and innovation to step up the fight against food loss and waste as ""our planet is a small boat in the universe"".""innovative postharvest treatment, digital agriculture and food systems and re-modelling market channels offer huge potential to tackle the challenges of food loss and waste. we have just built a partnership with ibm, microsoft and the vatican to empower artificial intelligence in all these areas,"" added qu.inger andersen, executive director of unep, encouraged governments to make food loss and waste part of national climate strategies.""only 11 countries have so far included food loss in their nationally determined contributions. none of them included food waste. by including food loss and waste and sustainable diets in revised climate plans, policymakers can improve their mitigation and adaptation from food systems by as much as 25 percent,"" said andersen.calling food loss and waste ""an ethical outrage"" given that so many people go hungry, antónio guterres, united nations secretary-general, in a message sent in support of the day, urged everyone to play their part in tackling this issue - from countries setting a reduction target and measuring their food loss and waste and policy action in this area being included in climate plans under the paris agreement to businesses taking a similar approach and individuals shopping carefully, storing food correctly, and using leftovers.the need for everyone to come together and step up efforts to reduce food loss and waste, including through innovation, technologies and education, to shift behavioural norms away from waste, to measure and track progress, as well as work towards increasing the availability of food and reducing the environmental footprint of agricultural production - topics to be explored in depth at the 2021 food system summit - were echoed by speakers and panel discussion participants from the un, european commission, private and public sectors, agriculture ministries of developing and developed countries, farmers', markets' and consumers' organisations and associations, academia and chefs.solutions to reduce food loss and wastesolutions to stem food loss and waste include: good data to know where in the value chain the major hot spots of food loss and waste are; applying innovation - for example, e-commerce platforms for marketing or retractable mobile food processing systems; government incentives to bolster private sector food loss and waste action and collaboration across supply chains; investments in training, technology and innovation, including for small-scale producers; better food packaging and relaxing on regulations and standards on aesthetic requirements for fruit and vegetables; behaviours that value and make the most of food at home; redistributing safe surplus food to those in need through food banks; facilitating farmer's access to consumers and shorter value chains through farmers markets and rural urban linkages; and investing more to strengthen infrastructure and logistics, including sustainable cold chains and cooling technologies.in many countries a large proportion of produce is lost during transportation. to address this, fao has introduced improved, sustainable bulk packaging (in the form of stackable and nestable plastic crates), along with good post-harvest management practice, to transport fresh produce in a number of southern and south-eastern asian countries. the use of crates during transport has reduced losses of vegetables and fruits by up to 87 percent. where crates replaced single-use plastic bags, this has also brought environmental benefits. (source sofa 2019, p. 36)unep, together with high-level coalition champions 12.3, has developed a target-measure-act approach to food loss and waste reduction. the united kingdom, a pioneer of this approach, has achieved a 27 percent reduction in post-farm gate food loss and waste per capita by 2018 relative to its 2007 baseline, making it the first country in the world to have advanced more than halfway towards the achievement of sdg 12.3. good data has helped the uk to make the case for action, together with an effective public-private partnership to facilitate cross supply chain collaboration, leveraging innovation in food promotion, labeling, and design, and a long-standing public behaviour change campaign, with re-doubled efforts and impacts on household food behaviours during the global pandemic. several companies including tesco (central europe), campbell, and arla foods have achieved food loss and waste reductions of more than 25 percent-suggesting that achieving the target is possible for companies, too.a new african centre of excellence for sustainable cooling and cold chain based in rwanda is helping get farmers' produce to market quickly and efficiently - reducing food waste, boosting profits and creating jobs.elsewhere, young entrepreneurs like isaac sesi - who spoke at the event - also fight food loss with innovation. sesi and the feed the future innovation lab for the reduction of post-harvest loss at kansas state university are providing farmers in ghana - isaac's home country - with an affordable moisture meter called grainmate, which measures the moisture content of maize and other grains, helping farmers ensure the grains are sufficiently dried and tackle the main cause of post-harvest loss in grain - insufficient drying before storage, which creates conditions for fungal growth, contamination and insect infestation.food loss and waste - facts and figures in terms of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, the food that is lost is associated with around 1.5 gigatonnes of co2 equivalent every year. unep will publish new country level food waste estimates at retail, food service and household level in its food waste index report, early in 2021, and a common methodology for food waste measurement at national level on world food day, october 16th 2020. studies commissioned by fao before the pandemic estimate that on-farm losses in sub-saharan africa for fruits and vegetables are up to 50 percent, the highest in the world. for cereals and pulses, the on-farm losses are up to 18 percent, equal highest in the world with parts of asia. reducing food loss early in the supply chain - on the farm - in countries with high levels of food insecurity is likely to yield the strongest positive result for greater food security. many countries deal with the growing demand for food by increasing agricultural production without reducing food loss and waste, and, thereby, exacerbating pressure on the environment and increasingly scarce natural resources.more about the eventthe marking of the day - under the slogan stop food loss and waste. for the people. for the planet - took place during the 75th session of the un general assembly.the event was hosted by fao and unep - the agencies leading global efforts on food loss and waste reduction together with andorra, argentina and san marino who were instrumental in establishing the international day through a un general assembly resolution adopted unanimously last year.keynote speakers included: luis basterra, argentina's minister of agriculture, livestock and fisheries; maria ubach font, andorra's minister of foreign affairs; luca beccari, san marino's minister of foreign affairs, international economic cooperation and telecommunications; bekir pakdemirli, turkey's minister of agriculture and forestry; stella kyriakides, european commissioner, health and food safety; gilbert f. houngbo, president, international fund for agriculture development; amir abdulla, deputy executive director, world food programme; martien van nieuwkoop, global director for agriculture and food, world bank; and chef josé andrés.keynote addresses were followed by two panel discussions - on food loss and waste and sustainability, and innovation.a list of the event's speakers and panel participants can be found here.a video of the event can be found here.",2021-04-16

and highlighted that innovation also encompassed ""innovation of policies and business models for agri-food systems"".qu stressed that europe and central asia was a region ""so important for fao and for the global agricultural transformation"".itu secretary-general houlin zhao said that itu was ""committed to turning the digital revolution into a development revolution"", including by helping farmers to take full advantage of new technologies such as 5g and artificial intelligence (ai) so they can increase their food production whilst respecting the environment.he also stressed that infrastructure, investment, innovation and inclusiveness were crucial for enabling all smallholder farmers to benefit from information and communication technology (ict) services, which were out of reach or too expensive in many rural areas.fao and itu published earlier this year a study on the status of digital agriculture in 18 countries in europe and central asia, which found that most countries covered in the publication have not yet implemented a national strategy for the agricultural sector's use of icts.how to drive innovation and digitalization in europe and central asiaturkey's minister of agriculture and forestry bekir pakdemirli gave concrete examples of how his country was applying innovative and digital agricultural solutions, recognizing that the agricultural sector was behind others when it came to the adoption of digitalization.one such solution adopted in turkey is the digital agriculture market that covers the entire food supply chain. the blockchain based market brings together buyers and sellers, and provides finance, insurance and transportation services. another example he presented was an e-learning academy that offers farmers training in some 200 titles in many food and agriculture fields.turkey is also developing a national e-agriculture strategy for 2020-2025, with support from fao, added the minister.doris marquardt, programme officer at the directorate-general for agriculture and rural development of the european commission stressed the need for creating an enabling environment to drive digitalization in agriculture - from strengthening broadband capacities, building digital skills to bringing researchers and end users together.speaking on behalf of the private sector in uzbekistan, murod khusanov outlined innovative start-ups such as an agriculture machinery sharing platform and cited agromart - a digital platform that provides a range of services and information, such as market updates on major commodities, as well as free online consultations and training for uzbek farmers.andrea ferrante, coordinator of schola campesina aps, who represented the civil society and smallholder farmers, highlighted the need for social innovation, digital inclusion and well-regulated digital innovation. in this respect, he stressed the need for rules that protect farmers' rights on data - to avoid ""data grabbing"".jannes maes, president of the european council of young farmers, noted that youth have the capacity to use digital products and services if they are affordable.he also described the value of digital technologies for young farmers, including, for example, animal diseases early warning systems; the provision of vital market information; and access to communication, giving youth the chance to live in remote rural areas but still be connected to the world at large.leaving no one behind in the digital agein closing, fao's chief economist máximo torero highlighted several fao-led innovative solutions that aim to double down on hunger- and poverty-fighting efforts.the hand-in-hand initiative, an evidence-based initiative, aims at accelerating agricultural transformation and sustainable rural development, including by deploying sophisticated tools such as advanced geospatial modelling and analysis.the data lab for statistical innovation uses artificial intelligence amongst others to provide new data sources that can help, for example, to measure food loss or land degradation in a timely manner. the hand-in-hand geospatial platform brings together thousands of statistics - from fao and partners - on food security, crops, soil, land, water, climate, fisheries, livestock or forestry. amongst its many uses, the platform provides vital information to monitor agricultural systems at risk due to human pressure on land and water, or to analyze weather-related trends.the hand-in-hand tools are key for furthering knowledge and understanding on where agricultural investments are most needed.",2021-04-16

""this is proof that we can win the war against hunger and should inspire countries to move forward, with the assistance of the international community as needed,"" the heads of fao, ifad and wfp, josé graziano da silva, kanayo f. nwanze and ertharin cousin, wrote in their foreword to the report. they stressed that ""accelerated, substantial and sustainable hunger reduction is possible with the requisite political commitment,"" and that ""this has to be well informed by sound understanding of national challenges, relevant policy options, broad participation and lessons from other experiences.""   sofi 2014 noted how access to food has improved rapidly and significantly in countries that have experienced overall economic progress, notably in eastern and south-eastern asia. access to food has also improved in southern asia and latin america, but mainly in countries with adequate safety nets and other forms of social protection including for the rural poor. hunger reduction has accelerated, but some lag behind despite significant progress overall, several regions and sub-regions continue to lag behind. in sub-saharan africa, more than one in four people remain chronically undernourished, while asia, the world's most populous region, is also home to the majority of the hungry - 526 million people.  latin america and the caribbean have made the greatest overall strides in increasing food security. meanwhile oceania has accomplished only a modest improvement (1.7 percent decline) in the prevalence of undernourishment, which stood at 14.0 percent in 2012-14, and has actually seen the number of its hungry increase since 1990-92. the agency heads noted that of the 63 countries which have reached the mdg target, 25 have also achieved the more ambitious world food summit (wfs) target of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015. however, the report indicated that time has run out on reaching the wfs target at the global level. creating an enabling environment through coordinated actions with the number of undernourished people remaining ""unacceptably high"", the agency heads stressed the need to renew the political commitment to tackle hunger and to transform it into concrete actions. in this context, the heads of fao, ifad and wfp welcomed the pledge at the 2014 african union summit in june to end hunger on the continent by 2025. ""food insecurity and malnutrition are complex problems that cannot be solved by one sector or stakeholder alone, but need to be tackled in a coordinated way,"" they added, calling on governments to work closely with the private sector and civil society. the fao, ifad and wfp report specifies that hunger eradication requires establishing an enabling environment and an integrated approach. such an approach includes public and private investments to increase agricultural productivity; access to land, services, technologies and markets; and measures to promote rural development and social protection for the most vulnerable, including strengthening their resilience to conflicts and natural disasters. the report also emphasizes the importance of specific nutrition programmes, particularly to address micronutrient deficiencies of mothers and children under five.  case studies this year's report includes seven case studies - bolivia, brazil, haiti, indonesia, madagascar, malawi and yemen - that highlight some of the ways that countries tackle hunger and how external events may influence their capacity to deliver on achieving food security and nutrition objectives. the countries were chosen because of their political, economic - particularly in the agricultural sector - diversities, and cultural differences.  bolivia, for example, has created institutions to involve a range of stakeholders, particularly previously marginalized indigenous people. brazil's zero hunger programme, which placed achievement of food security at the centre of the government's agenda, is at the heart of progress that led the country to achieve both the mdg and wfs targets. current programmes to eradicate extreme poverty in the country build on the approach of linking policies for family farming with social protection in a highly inclusive manner. haiti, where more than half the population is chronically undernourished, is still struggling to recover from the effects of the devastating 2010 earthquake. the report notes how the country has adopted a national programme to strengthen livelihoods and improve agricultural productivity by supporting small family farmers' access to inputs and services. indonesia has adopted legal frameworks and established institutions to improve food security and nutrition. its policy coordination mechanism involves ministries, ngos and community leaders. measures address a wide range of challenges from agricultural productivity growth to nutritious and safe diets. madagascar is emerging from a political crisis and is resuming relationships with international development partners aimed at tackling poverty and malnutrition. it is also working in partnership to build resilience to shocks and climate hazards, including cyclones, droughts and locust invasions, which often afflict the island nation.  malawi has reached the mdg hunger target, thanks to a strong and persistent commitment to boost maize production. however, malnutrition remains a challenge - 50 percent of children under five are stunted and 12.8 percent are underweight. to address the issue, the government is promoting community-based nutrition interventions to diversify production to include legumes, milk, fisheries and aquaculture, for healthier diets, and to improve incomes at the household level.  conflict, economic downturn, low agricultural productivity and poverty have made yemen one of the most food-insecure countries in the world. besides restoring political security and economic stability, the government aims to reduce hunger by one-third by 2015 and to make 90 percent of the population food-secure by 2020. it also aims to reduce the current critical rates of child malnutrition by at least one percentage point per year. the findings and recommendations of sofi 2014 will be discussed by governments, civil society, and private sector representatives at the 13-18 october meeting of the committee on world food security, at fao headquarters in rome.the report will also be a focus of the second international conference on nutrition (icn2) in rome from 19-21 november, which fao is jointly organizing with the world health organization. this high-level intergovernmental meeting seeks, at a global level, renewed political commitment to combat malnutrition with the overall goal of improving diets and raising nutrition levels.",2021-04-16

""we have given ourselves an enormous task, that begins with the historic commitment of not only reducing but also eradicating poverty and hunger in a sustainable way,"" he said during his speech at the un's sustainable development summit. fourteen of the 17 new sdgs adopted at the summit are related to fao's historic mission, the director-general noted. the second goal - which is ""to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture"" - must be urgently pursued as rapid progress on that front is the key to the other goals, he added.sustainable agriculture and zero hunger ""we can only rest when we achieve zero hunger,"" graziano da silva said. the sdgs follow and expand on the millennium development goals, established in 2001 and ending this year, which set a hunger reduction target that was met by more than half of the countries monitored by fao. but nearly 800 million people still suffer from chronic undernourishment. a majority of the world's poor and hungry live in rural areas, and improving their livelihoods is the core challenge, graziano da silva said. doing so will require promoting inclusive growth and making responsible investments that address the needs of the world's poor, he said. ""we need to build more sustainable agriculture and food systems, that are resilient to stresses and better able to cope with - and respond to - climate change impact,"" he added. investing in environmentally sustainable agriculture on its own will not suffice, and well-designed social protection systems will also be required, graziano da silva added. he reminded world leaders that in the next 15 years an additional investment of 160 dollars per year per person living in extreme poverty is needed to end hunger.  ""this represents less than half percent of global income in 2014. and it is only a small fraction of the cost that hunger and malnutrition impose on economies, societies and people,"" he said.",2021-04-16

the world's food systems are responsible for more than one-third of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, according to a pioneering new study published in nature food.spanning from land-use change and agricultural production to packaging and waste management, food system emissions were estimated at 18 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2015. that's 34 percent of the total, a share that is gradually declining - it was 44 percent in 1990 - even as food systems emissions kept increasing in absolute amounts. the study, co-authored by francesco tubiello, a senior statistician and climate-change specialist at the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) in collaboration with researchers at the european commission's joint research centre in ispra, italy, offers a treasure trove of data and, at least as importantly, presents a new data base - edgar-food -  going back to 1990 and enabling granular tracking of ongoing and future trends. the new tool, reliant on key land-use data from faostat, provides a complete and consistent data series spanning multiple sectors that will prove essential in the design of effective mitigation actions and transformational pathways to sustainable food systems. it also offers more precise understanding and estimate of the climate effects of food production, distribution and consumption ahead of the landmark united nations food systems summit 2021 later this year. the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) special report on climate change and land recently attributed to food systems between 11 and 19 billion tonnes of emissions per year, a wide range underscoring the need to narrow our knowledge gaps. the edgar-food data base represents a milestone for understanding how the global food system has developed. it enables assessments of how changes in consumer behavior or technological evolution may impact food-system ghg emissions and can serve as a precious tool for researchers focusing on specific sectors as well as policy makers tasked with designing mitigation strategies that don't merely displace emissions to other sectors. fao has powerful emissions data sets on agriculture and land use and is building a new one to support the work of the un food systems summit. key findingssome two-thirds of the emissions from global food systems come from the land-based sector, comprising agriculture, land use and land use changes. that figure is higher for developing countries, but also declining significantly in step with decreasing deforestation and increasing downstream activities such as food processing and refrigeration. in terms of their share of all anthropogenic ghg emissions, food systems of industrialized countries are broadly stable at around 24 percent, while in developing countries it has decreased notably - partly due to very high increases in non-food emissions -  to 39 percent in 2015 from 68 percent in 1990. top emitters are, in order: china, indonesia, united states of america, brazil, european union and india. production stages that bring foodstuffs to the farm gate - including inputs such as fertilizers - are now the leading contributor to overall food-system emissions, constituting 39 percent of the total. land use and related factors contribute 38 percent, while distribution accounts for 29 percent, a share that is growing and expected to continue to do so. methane (ch4) accounts for around 35 percent of food system ghg emissions, broadly the same in developed and developing countries, and mostly stems from livestock raising and rice cultivation. the research highlights how global food systems are becoming more energy intensive, reflecting trends in the retail, packaging, transport and processing sectors, whose emissions are growing rapidly in some developing countries. industrialized countries, meanwhile, have increased emission of fluorinated greenhouse gases - which have a turbocharged effect on global warming - used in refrigeration and other industrial applications. refrigeration is responsible for nearly half of the energy consumption by the retail and supermarket sector, whose emissions have grown more than fourfold in europe since 1990. worldwide ""cold chain"" activities account for around 5 percent of global food-system emissions, a figure expected to increase. it also revealed that packaging now contributes about 5.4 percent of global food-system emissions, more than any other supply-chain factor including transportation. however, emissions intensity varies notably by product, with wine and beer accounting for a significant share of packaging impacts while bananas and beet sugar have higher transportation emissions. on average, global per capita annual food-related emissions declined from 1990 to 2015 by around one third to 2 tonnes of co2 equivalent. that figure should not be understood as the same as a ""consumer footprint"" as these vary according to specific dietary patterns, but it can be used to benchmark national mitigation efforts to reduce ghg emissions from the food system as a whole.",2021-04-16

april 2015, rome -- geothermal energy, the flow of heat energy radiating from the earth<U+0092>s core, provides unique opportunities for cost efficient, sustainable food production and processing in developing countries, says a new report published by fao today.  in some developing economies, as much as half of all food produced is lost post-harvest <U+0096> that's due in part to a lack of affordable energy for food processing, according to <U+0093>uses of geothermal energy in food and agriculture<U+0094>.  this makes the use of heat energy for drying foods, pasteurizing milk and sterilizing produce especially interesting for developing countries, where increased food processing can give a boost to food security.  food drying can prolong the shelf life of nutritious foods like fish and vegetables and make them available year-round, including in times of drought.  geothermal energy is also a prime source for heating greenhouses, soils, and water for fish farming, the report says.  developing countries that have much to gain from harnessing heat energy for agriculture include those in the so-called ring of fire along the pacific plate, such as mexico, indonesia, the philippines and various countries along the pacific coast of south america. so do ethiopia and kenya in africa<U+0092>s rift valley, and transitioning economies in eastern europe, including romania and macedonia.  the case for geothermal <U+0093>it<U+0092>s an energy source that<U+0092>s renewable, clean and low-cost once you<U+0092>ve made the initial investment to harness it,<U+0094> says carlos da silva, senior agribusiness economist in fao<U+0092>s rural infrastructure and agro-industries division.  <U+0093>by using a clean energy source, you<U+0092>re not only addressing cost but also the environmental impacts of food production and processing,<U+0094> according to da silva.  agriculture both consumes energy and emits greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.  research suggests that using geothermal heating for greenhouses decreases fungus infections and cuts fuel costs by up to 80 percent, providing significant savings to operating budgets.  and while oil and gas can be costly and scarcely available in parts of the world, the estimated 42 million megawatts (mw) of power that radiates from the earth<U+0092>s 5000-degrees-celsius core won<U+0092>t run out for billions of years.  <U+0093>geothermal energy for agriculture can be done even at small-scales and can significantly contribute to income generation, providing employment and improving food and nutrition security in developing countries,<U+0094> adds divine njie, ags deputy director and co-editor of the report. from electricity to agriculture worldwide, 38 countries currently use geothermal energy for direct application in agricultural production and some 24 countries harness it to generate electricity, with iceland, costa rica, el salvador, kenya, new zealand and the philippines deriving more than 10 percent of their electricity needs from natural heat sources.  of the 23 developing countries that are using geothermal, the majority currently apply it to space heating and recreational purposes like bathing only, leaving its significant potential for agricultural uses untapped.  still, successful geothermal agricultural projects are underway in just under half of those countries, including in aquaculture, farming and processing.   success stories a government-funded project in algeria is supporting the building of fish farms that utilize hot water from drill holes to heat tilapia ponds. the three farms built so far produce an average 1700 tonnes of tilapia per year.  iceland <U+0096> which derives most of its heating and electricity from geothermal power -- has been a leader in the use of geothermal power for agriculture since the 1920s. in addition to greenhouse heating, some 20 companies across iceland dry between 2000 and 4000 tonnes of fish each year, while an emerging industry for geothermal pet food drying is currently producing 500 tonnes of animal feed annually.  challenges start-up costs remain the main barrier to developing countries<U+0092> exploring geothermal energy uses on a larger scale, making it all the more necessary for governments to take a leading role in attracting investment and creating policy environments that support the sector, according to fao.  <U+0093>you can invest in ground proofs and not find any economically viable heat sources,<U+0094> says da silva, adding that even in successful cases, selling energy at a low cost can be a challenge when having to recover start-up costs.  nevertheless, various projects outlined in the fao report show that these obstacles are not insurmountable and investments worth exploring in the larger effort of making agriculture more sustainable.  indeed, <U+0093>the fao report also shows that there are direct-use opportunities which do not require high-cost exploration and exploitation<U+0094>, says njie.  an example of geothermal energy use: drying chilies and garlic in thailand chillies and garlic are highly popular in thailand, where people eat them both fresh and dried. in one project there, waste heat from a geothermal power plant is being used to dry these important food products in compartments that can hold 450 kg of chilies or 220 kg of garlic at a time. the required air temperatures are 70 °c for chillies and 50 °c for garlic. the total energy consumed is just 13.3 megajoules per kilogram of water evaporated for chillies, and 1.5 mj/kg of water for garlic. this type of dryer has relatively low running costs and can be used in any weather conditions.",2021-04-16

""business as usual would mean a huge and simultaneous increase in the need for food, energy and water in the next decades: 60 percent more food, 50 percent more energy and 40 percent more water by 2050,"" graziano da silva said during his remarks. fao estimates point to the need to increase food production by 60 percent by 2050 to feed a population that will top the 9 billion mark. to address the challenge of feeding more people while using less land, water and energy, concerted efforts and investments are needed to support a widespread, globe-spanning transition to sustainable farming systems and land management practices, according to fao's director-general. biofuels: food first, but opportunities remain climate change and increasing competition between food and non-food agricultural products such as bioenergy have made the challenges of feeding the future more complex, said graziano da silva. ""but it is important not to forget that biofuel emerged with strength as an alternative energy source because of the need to mitigate fossil fuel production and greenhouse gases <U+0096> and that need has not changed,"" he added. the fao head argued for a more pragmatic approach to the issue. ""we need to move from the food versus fuel debate to a food and fuel debate. there is no question: food comes first,"" he said, adding: ""but biofuels should not be simply seen as a threat or as a magical solution. like anything else, they can do good or bad."" evidence shows that when developed responsibly, sustainable biofuel production systems can offer an additional source of income for poor farmers. the fao director-general noted that thanks to experience gained in recent years and new biofuel production technologies, countries today are better positioned to evaluate the opportunities and risks of biofuel production and to use it when it pays off socially, environmentally and economically. he also stressed that in order to avoid conflicts with food production, mandatory biofuel policies must be flexible and ""need to be adjusted according to the reality, the ongoing balance of production, and stocks of the different products used."" speaking more generally on the contributions a shift to sustainable agriculture can make, he said the world's food systems must achieve much greater efficiencies in their use of natural resources, in particular water, energy and land <U+0096> including reducing food waste and they must do much more to protect, conserve and restore natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystem functions. fao recently put in place five key, strategic objectives to focus and guide its work. they include making agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable, and enabling a shift to efficient agricultural and food systems.",2021-04-16

""with only ten years left to achieve the sustainable development goals"", qu added, ""we need a fundamental change of mindset and remodelling our business approaches"".  a new way of thinking fao green cities initiative aims to improve the livelihoods and well-being of urban and peri-urban populations in at least 100 cities (15 metropolitan, 40 intermediary and 45 small cities) around the world in the next three years, looking to have 1000 cities join by 2030. in particular, the initiative is focused on improving the urban environment, strengthening urban-rural linkages and the resilience of urban systems, services and populations to external shocks. ensuring access to a healthy environment and healthy diets from sustainable food systems, it will also contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation and sustainable resource management. the new initiative also includes the creation of a ""green cities network"", where cities of all sizes - from megapolis to medium to small - will exchange experiences on best practices, successes and lessons, as well as build city-to-city cooperation opportunities.  fao will enhance its work with local and national authorities, city councils, mayors, the private sector, academic institutions and international organizations, and engage with urban communities - especially with women and young people. ""the initiative we are launching today is a product of a new way of thinking. i hope that you are inspired to join us and support it by your innovative way of implementation!"", the fao director-general concluded. why is urban greening important? the world is becoming more and more urbanized. by 2050, almost 70 percent of the world's population will be living in cities, with 90 percent of the increase occurring in africa and asia. about 70 percent of all food supplies are consumed by urban dwellers - a number that is steadily on the rise. population growth and rapid urbanization imply dietary shifts and an increasing demand for basic goods and services, as well as growing competition for natural resources to ensure access to healthy diets for all. local administrations are finding it more and more difficult to meet the needs of urban and peri-urban populations and the covid-19 pandemic has added new challenges, such as food systems disruptions, loss of jobs and food insecurity, worsening conditions especially for the most vulnerable. as a result, many urban and peri-urban communities are now more than ever exposed to food and nutrition insecurity combined with diet-related non-communicable diseases as well as increasing rates of overweight and obesity. today cities consume almost 80 percent of the total energy produced in the world. they are responsible for 70 percent of global waste and account for about 70 percent of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. maintaining sustainable food systems and having more green spaces, including urban and peri-urban agriculture and forests are essential for cities, making them more resilient in dealing with the impacts of climate change and covid-19, ensuring that health-related issues do not disrupt urban food supply and distribution. about the event in addition to the fao green cities initiative, today's event also highlighted initiatives and programmes that are scaling up innovation and accelerating action, including milan urban food policy pact, the new urban agenda, world sustainable urban food centre of valencia, hand-in-hand initiative and other strategic partnerships. the high-level event saw the participation of achim steiner, administrator of the un development programme (undp), maimunah mohd sharif, executive director of united nations human settlements programme (un-habitat); li yong, director-general of united nations industrial development organization (unido); jürgen rigterink, acting president of european bank for reconstruction and development (ebrd); carlos manuel rodriguez, chief executive officer, global environment facility (gef); rémy rioux, chief executive officer, agence française de développement (a message was delivered on his behalf); javier manzanares, deputy executive secretary of the green climate fund, among others.  the event also featured testimonials from the following city leaders around the globe that are in line with the fao green cities initiative: daniel quintero, mayor of medellin, colombia; giuseppe sala, mayor of milan, italy (via video message); manuel de araujo, mayor of quelimane, mozambique; wen guohui, mayor of guangzhou, people's republic of china (via video message); souad abderrahim, mayor of tunis, tunisia; bruno covas, mayor of sao paulo, brazil (via video message) and a message from the office of the mayor of new york.",2021-04-16
"100","Overweight affects almost half the population of all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean except for Haiti","http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6747s.pdf, http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/","19 january 2017, santiago, chile - obesity and overweight are on the rise throughout latin america and the caribbean, and are particularly prevalent among women and children, according to a new report by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) and the pan american health organization (paho). the panorama of food and nutrition security in latin america and the caribbean report, noted that close to 360 million people - around 58 percent of the inhabitants of the region - are overweight with the highest rates observed in the bahamas (69 percent), mexico (64percent) and chile (63 percent). with the exception of haiti (38.5 percent), paraguay (48.5precent) and nicaragua (49.4percent), overweight affects more than half the population of all countries in the region. the report also noted obesity affects 140 million people - 23 percent of the region's population - and that the highest rates are to be found in the caribbean countries of barbados (36 percent) trinidad and tobago, antigua and barbuda all at around 31 percent. the increase in obesity has disproportionately impacted women: in more than 20 countries in latin america and the caribbean, the rate of female obesity is 10 percentage points higher than that of men. according to fao's regional representative eve crowley, ""the alarming rates of overweight and obesity in latin america and the caribbean should act as a wake-up call to governments in the region to introduce policies that address all forms of hunger and malnutrition and to do this by linking food security, sustainability, agriculture, nutrition and health."" paho's director carissa f. etienne explained that: ""the region faces a double burden of malnutrition. this needs to be tackled through balanced diets that include fresh, healthy, nutritious and sustainably produced food, as well as addressing the main social factors that determine malnutrition, such as lack of access to healthy food, water and sanitation, education and health services, and social protection programs, among others."" linking agriculture, food, nutrition and health the fao/paho panorama report points out that one of the main factors contributing to the rise of obesity and overweight has been the change in dietary patterns. economic growth, increased urbanization, higher average incomes and the integration of the region into international markets have reduced the consumption of traditional preparations and increased consumption of ultra-processed products, a problem that has had greater impact on areas and countries that are net food importers. to address this situation, fao and paho call for the promotion of healthy and sustainable food systems that link agriculture, food, nutrition and health. to this end, countries should promote the sustainable production of fresh, safe and nutritious foods, ensuring their supply, diversity and access, especially for the most vulnerable sectors. this should be complemented with nutrition education and consumer warnings about the nutritional composition of foods high in sugar, fat and salt. child malnutrition falls but still affects the poorest according to the report, the region has managed to reduce hunger considerably and today only 5.5 percent of the population lives undernourished, with the caribbean being the subregion with the highest prevalence (almost 20 percent), largely due to the fact that haiti has the highest rate of undernourished on the planet - 53 percent. the situation concerning stunting in latin america and the caribbean has also improved: it fell from around 25 percent in 1990 to 11 percent in 2015, a reduction of 7.8 million children. despite these advances, around 6 million children are still stunted while 700,000 - 1.3 percent of children under 5 years - suffer wasting. virtually all countries have been successful in improving the nutrition of their children, but it should be noted that malnutrition affects the poorest and rural areas the most. ""that's where governments need to focus their efforts,"" crowley said. increase in child overweight the report shows that in latin america and the caribbean, around 4 million children - just over 7 percent - of children under the age of 5 are overweight. since 1990, the largest increases in overweight among children - in terms of numbers - were seen in mesoamerica and in terms of prevalence in the caribbean where the rate increased from around 4 percent to almost 7. policies to improve nutrition the report noted how several governments have introduced policies aimed at improving the nutrition of their citizens. for example barbados, dominica and mexico have approved taxes for sugar-sweetened beverages, while bolivia, chile, peru and ecuador have healthy food laws that regulate food advertising and/or labeling. paho director etienne emphasized that these measures should be complemented with policies to increase the supply and access to fresh food and safe water and others focused on the strengthening of family farming as well as the development of short production and marketing circuits, public procurement programs and food and nutrition education programs. improving the sustainability of agriculture according to the report, the current trajectory of regional agricultural growth is unsustainable, owing, among other factors, to the serious consequences it is having on the region's ecosystems and natural resources. ""the sustainability of our region's food supply and its future diversity is under threat, unless we change the way we do things,"" crowley said, noting that 127 million tons of food are lost or wasted annually in latin america and caribbean. according to fao and paho, the use of land and other natural resources must be made more efficient and sustainable, the techniques of food production, storage and processing must be improved, and food losses and waste must be reduced to ensure equitable access to food for all.   what are overweight and obesity? overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.body mass index (bmi) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. it is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m2).for adults, who defines overweight and obesity as follows: overweight is a bmi greater than or equal to 25; and obesity is a bmi greater than or equal to 30.bmi provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. however, it should be considered a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals.for children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity.visit who's page for more information",2021-04-16

""transforming food systems to be sustainable means making changes that are at once economic, social and cultural,"" said gilbert f. houngbo, the president of the international fund for agricultural development (ifad). ""this is why ifad-supported projects take a holistic approach, backing investment with policy support, knowledge and training activities. because diversified production has to mesh with diversified diets and be accepted by nutrition- and climate-conscious consumers."" stéphane le foll, a former french agriculture minister, gave the key note address. he urged dialogue and action to create a new doubly green revolution in agricultural production based on nature, local knowledge, and science. we are at a watershed in the history of mankind and it is up to us to make our choices  major choices  which will be essential to our collective future, he said. a global dialogue the three-day symposium brings together 700 policy-makers, agroecology practitioners, academics, and representatives from government, civil society, the private sector and un agencies to discuss key elements and actions to support scaling up agroecology. the symposium will focus on identifying needs, challenges and opportunities to promote agroecology policies, practices and investments.  on the final day, the scaling-up initiative will be launched. it aims to encourage more inclusive and holistic agroecology transition processes through tools, knowledge and policy processes for transformation of food and agricultural systems.a path to sustainable development one example of agroecology in action is an ecosystem engineered by chinese farmers that sees leaves from mulberry trees fed to silkworms whose bodily waste is then fed to fish. the organic material in the fish pond sludge is then used as fertilizer for the mulberry trees, thus completing a virtuous production circle. for centuries this system has also supported ancillary businesses such as the manufacture of silk. agroecology can safeguard natural resources and biodiversity, as well as promote adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. it can also improve the resilience of family farmers, especially in developing countries where hunger is concentrated. it can contribute to the production and consumption of healthy and nutritious food, and boost local economies and markets. these multiple benefits make agroecology an important path for meeting the 2030 agenda and addressing interlinked challenges.knowledge and innovation to drive change  investing in knowledge and innovation is key to realizing agroecology's full potential. the symposium includes an exhibition highlighting innovations in agroecology from around the world. a team of spanish scientists are exhibiting conect-e which is an online platform designed for farmers and others to record and share traditional ecological knowledge with scientists.  a ghanaian exhibit highlights a farmer-led project supported by actionaid that promotes women's access to agricultural extension services with a focus on promoting agroecology. the project has resulted in smallholder women farmers increasing their agricultural production through agroecology with less dependence on external inputs such as herbicides. building momentum the first agroecology symposium was held at fao in 2014 and since then regional meetings have been held in latin america, sub-saharan africa, europe, central asia and asia and the pacific.  in the last four years, more than 1,400 participants from 170 countries have been involved in this global effort to discuss and highlight the importance and potential of agroecology.",2021-04-16
"102","A first atlas on rural migration in sub-Saharan Africa","http://www.fao.org/3/i7951en/I7951EN.pdf, http://www.cirad.fr/en, http://governanceinnovation.org/","2 november, rome  a first atlas to offer a better understanding of complex rural migration patterns in sub-saharan africa has been published today.  the atlas  rural africa in motion. dynamics and drivers of migration south of the sahara  also highlights the important role rural areas will continue to play in shaping the continents migration for decades to come.   population growth translates into a massive expansion of the labour force. some 380 million new working age people are expected to enter the job market by 2030. of those about 220 million are likely to be in rural areas. the challenge is to generate enough employment to absorb this booming labour force. this is why agriculture and rural development must be an integral part of any response to large migratory movements to harness the potential of migration for development, said kostas stamoulis, fao assistant director-general, economic and social development department. through a series of maps and in depth case studies, the 20 authors of the atlas, representing different research institutions, think tanks and international organizations from and outside africa, explore the complexity of the interrelated causes that drive people in africa to leave their homes. they shed light on regional migration dynamics and perspectives, and foster understanding of rural migration. ""the atlas is timely as the need for new analytical tools to improve our understanding of africa's migration is becoming more and more pressing. in the face of climate change and unprecedented population growth, the atlas doesn't only provide a stimulating overview on rural migration, it can also help shape more coordinated and coherent actions to address migration,"" added kostas stamoulis. the atlas is the result of a partnership between the french agricultural research centre for international development (cirad) and the food and agriculture organization of united nations (fao), with technical support from the centre for the study of governance innovation (govinn) in south africa.this atlas is an innovative contribution which will support the policy debate not only between governments and the international community, but also between and with local stakeholders, said jean-luc khalfaoui, cirads director general for research and strategy.  north versus sub-saharan africa: different migration flowsthe atlas notes that the vast majority of africans (75 percent) are migrating within africa, whilst the overwhelming majority of north africans (about 90 percent) migrate to europe. hence, sub-sharan africa ""is in motion"", but mainly within the limits of the continent. western and eastern africa are the most dynamic regions with about 5.7 and 3.6 million intra-regional migrants in 2015.   evidence also suggests that, in most sub-saharan africa countries, internal migration is the dominant migration pattern. for example, half of kenya's and senegal's migrants move within national borders, and in nigeria and uganda, in-country migration is as high as 80 percent. this supports global estimates indicating that the number of people moving within their countries is six times higher than the number of emigrants. sub-saharan africa: a unique context and demographic featuresub-saharan africa's population increased by 645 million people between 1975 and 2015, and is set to increase by 1.4 billion in the next forty years (by 2055) - a unique demographic feature in world history. by the middle of the century, the estimated rural population in sub-saharan africa is projected to increase by 63 percent. sub-saharan africa is the only region in the world where rural population will continue to grow after 2050. for a mostly rural africa, this population growth means a massive expansion of the labour force (about 220 million rural youth will enter the working age in the next 15 years), more dense rural areas, and a huge pressure on the agricultural sector, making the need for economic diversification and job creation more critical. who is migrating? rural migrants are mostly young people, and the majority come from farming families. around 60 percent of rural migrants are between 15 and 34 years old. most migrants are men; however in some countries like mozambique, democratic republic of the congo or burkina, women form the majority of those who are migrating. rural people have generally lower school attainments than their urban counterparts, and rural migrants are no exception. migrants tend, however, to spend more years in school than non-migrants do. more urban, but also more rural unlike in other parts of the world, sub-saharan africa has become more urban but without becoming more industrialized. cities are characterized by a precarious urban informal sector, often persistent poverty and limited formal employment opportunities. more so than elsewhere, africans move not only into towns, but also out of them and between rural areas.   a sprawling market in senegals capital. with limited formal employment opportunities, many africans move not only into towns, but also out of them. ©fao/jane hahn climate change and migration sub-saharan africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change due to its extensive reliance on rain-fed crop production, which represents 96 percent of agricultural land, and limited economic and institutional capacity to adapt to climate impacts. studies indicate that tropical regions will experience wheat and maize crop losses as a consequence of even small changes in temperatures. crop losses for major cereals are estimated at around 20 percent by 2050 if no action is taken to mitigate the effect of climate change. the atlas reflects on the complex link between climate change and rural migration. although environmental challenges can influence migration, the decision to migrate is also determined by social, economic and political factors. future of migration: unpredictable but manageable while the complexity of interrelated factors driving migration makes it impossible to exactly predict migration dynamics in the future, the atlas draws attention to crucial variables - such as size of rural population; location and occurrence of extreme weather events; poverty and hunger levels; job opportunities; quality of governance - to identify possible migration scenarios for the future. the atlas notes that managing the future of migration should involve: safe, orderly and regular migration channels; the development of sustainable large cities; a stronger investment in intermediary cities; and the development of smaller rural habitats with provision of quality services. it highlights that the decision of a rural person to migrate should not be dictated by survival or search for a decent life, but inspired by an aspiration for new experiences. for that to happen, it is necessary to invest in agriculture and rural development and to adopt a territorial perspective, fostering rural-urban linkages that will help to transform africa's rural areas into «safe havens» offering a better life.   youth tending to their vegetables as part of an fao initiative supporting young people at risk of migrating. creating farming and rural, off-farm opportunities key to address migration. ©fao/tamiru legesse",2021-04-16

"104","Cutting food waste to feed the world","http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ags/publications/GFL_web.pdf","11 may 2011, rome - roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year  approximately 1.3 billion tonnes  gets lost or wasted, according to an fao-commissioned study.the document, global food losses and food waste, was commissioned by fao from the swedish institute for food and biotechnology (sik) for save food!, an international congress being held in düsseldorf 16-17 may at the trade fair of the international packaging industry interpack2011.other key findings include: industrialized and developing countries dissipate roughly the same quantities of food  respectively 670 and 630 million tonnes. every year, consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food (222 million tonnes) as the entire net food production of sub-saharan africa (230 million tonnes).fruits and vegetables, plus roots and tubers have the highest wastage rates of any food. the amount of food lost or wasted every year is equivalent to more than half of the world's annual cereals crop (2.3 billion tonnes in 2009/2010). losses and wastethe report distinguishes between food loss and food waste. food losses  occurring at the production, harvest, post-harvest and processing phases  are most important in developing countries, due to poor infrastructure, low levels of technology and low investment in the food production systems.  food waste is more a problem in industrialized countries, most often caused by both retailers and consumers throwing perfectly edible foodstuffs into the trash. per capita waste by consumers is between 95-115 kg a year in europe and north america, while consumers in sub-saharan africa and south and southeast asia each throw away only 6-11 kg a year.total per capita food production for human consumption is about 900 kg a year in rich countries, almost twice the 460 kg a year produced in the poorest regions. in developing countries 40 percent of losses occur at post-harvest and processing levels while in industrialized countries more than 40 percent of losses happen at retail and consumer levels. food losses during harvest and in storage translate into lost income for small farmers and into higher prices for poor consumers, the report noted. reducing losses could therefore have an ""immediate and significant"" impact on their livelihoods and food security. squandering resourcesfood loss and waste also amount to a major squandering of resources, including water, land, energy, labour and capital and needlessly produce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. the report offered a number of practical suggestions on how to reduce losses and waste. in developing countries the problem is chiefly one of inadequate harvest techniques, poor post-harvest management and logistics, lack of suitable infrastructure, processing and packaging, and lack of marketing information which would allow production to better match demand.  the advice is therefore to strengthen the food supply chain by assisting small farmers to link directly to buyers. the private and public sectors should also invest more in infrastructure, transportation and in processing and packaging. in middle- and high-income countries food losses and waste stem largely from consumer behaviour but also from lack of communication between different actors in the supply chain. over-emphasis on appearanceat retail level, large quantities of food are also wasted due to quality standards that over-emphasize appearance.  surveys show that consumers are willing to buy  produce not meeting appearance standards as long as it is safe and tastes good. customers thus have the power to influence quality standards and should do so, the report said.    selling farm produce closer to consumers, without having to conform to supermarkets' quality standards, is another suggestion. this could be achieved through farmers' markets and farm shops. good use for food that would otherwise be thrown away should be found. commercial and charity organizations could work with retailers to collect, and then sell or use products that have been disposed of but are still good in terms of safety, taste and nutritional value..  changing consumer attitudesconsumers in rich countries are generally encouraged to buy more food than they need. ""buy three, pay two"" promotions are one example, while the oversized ready-to-eat meals produced by the food industry are another. restaurants frequently offer fixed-price buffets that spur customers to heap their plates. generally speaking, consumers fail to plan their food purchases properly, the report found. that means they often throw food away when ""best-before"" dates expired.  education in schools and political initiatives are possible starting points to changing consumer attitudes, the report suggested. rich-country consumers should be taught that throwing food away needlessly is unacceptable. they should also be made aware that given the limited availability of natural resources it is more effective to reduce food losses than increase food production in order to feed a growing world population. a separate report on food packaging for developing countries also prepared for the save food! congress noted that appropriate packaging is a key factor impacting on losses occurring at almost every stage of the food chain.",2021-04-16

""oil prices have fallen by more than half during the past month, which catalyzes a large downward impact on biofuels, which are an important source of demand in the markets for sugar and vegetable oils,"" said fao analyst peter thoenes.the fao dairy price index fell by 3.0 percent, driven by declining quotations and global import demand for skim and whole milk powders, due largely to disruptions in the dairy supply chains because of the containment measures aimed at controlling the spread of covid-19. the fao cereal price index in march declined 1.9 percent from february and stood at nearly its level of march 2019. international wheat prices declined, as the effects of large global supplies and broadly favorable crop prospects outweighed those of increased import demand from north africa and some small export limitations imposed by the russian federation. maize prices also declined due to both large supplies and much weaker demand from the biofuel sector. international rice prices, by contrast, rose for the third consecutive month, with indica quotations buoyed by stockpiling spurred by concerns over the pandemic and reports that vietnam might introduce export bans - which the government has since downplayed. fao director-general qu dongyu told national leaders at last week's g20 summit ""to make sure that agricultural trade continues to play its important role in contributing to global food security"" and to avoid policies that stymie trade flows that underpin food-supply systems. fao is closely monitoring prices and logistical issue for food commodities with an eye to alerting countries of emerging problems that could exacerbate potential disruptions during the pandemic. the fao meat price index fell by 0.6 percent, led by drops in international quotations for ovine and bovine meats, for which export availabilities are large and trade capacity dampened by logistic bottlenecks. but pig meat quotations rose amid surging global demand and as processing facilities were hampered by the restrictions on the movement of workers.comfortable cereal supplies fao's forecast for 2020 world wheat production remains unchanged from the previous month, at the near record level of last year, which, coupled with ample inventories, will help shield food markets from turmoil during the coronavirus storm. in this month's cereal supply and demand brief, also released today, fao's hiked its estimate for worldwide cereal output in 2019 to 2 721 million tonnes, a 2.4 percent increase from 2018 . by type, fao's 2019 estimates now stand at 1 445 million tonnes for coarse grains, 763 million tonnes for wheat and 512 million tonnes for rice (milled basis).while localized disruptions, mostly due to logistical issues, pose challenges to food supply chains in some markets, their anticipated duration and magnitude are unlikely to have a significant effect on global food markets, fao said. fao's 2020 forecast for world wheat production is unchanged from last month at 763 million tonnes, with expectations of lower outputs in the european union, ukraine and the united states of america compensated by anticipated production gains in the russian federation, india and pakistan - although locust infestations in the latter two countries could temper the foreseen increase. for maize, the leading coarse grain, bumper harvests are expected in brazil and argentina, and south africa's maize output is forecast to recover strongly after last year's drought. elsewhere, sowing decisions may be influenced by the downturn in international maize prices. fao's forecast for world cereal utilizations for 2019/20 has been raised slightly to 2 722 million tonnes, a 1.2 percent annual increase. world cereal stocks at the close of the 2020 seasons are expected to contract by 8 million tonnes from their opening levels, pushing the global cereals stock-to-use ratio down to 30.7 percent, which is still considered a comfortable level. world trade in cereals is forecast to increase by 2.3 percent from the previous year to reach 420 million tonnes.",2021-04-16
"106","UN agencies warn that COVID-19 and worsening inequalities will fuel malnutrition for billions in Asia and the Pacific","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb2895en","joint fao-unicef-wfp-who news release 20 january 2021, bangkok/rome - the economic impact of covid-19 on the world's most populous region is threatening to further undermine efforts to improve diets and nutrition of nearly two billion people in asia and the pacific who were already unable to afford healthy diets prior to the pandemic, says a new report published today by four specialized agencies of the united nations.  the report asia and the pacific regional overview of food security and nutrition 2020: maternal and child diets at the heart of improving nutrition' is jointly published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, the united nations children's fund, the world food programme and the world health organization. it found that 1.9 billion people were unable to afford a healthy diet, even before the covid-19 outbreak and the damage it has since caused to economies and individual livelihoods.  due to higher prices for fruits, vegetables and dairy products, it has become nearly impossible for poor people in asia and the pacific to achieve healthy diets, the affordability of which is critical to ensure food security and nutrition for all - and for mothers and children in particular.  food prices and available incomes govern household decisions on food and dietary intake. but the outbreak of covid-19 and a lack of decent work opportunities in many parts of the region, alongside significant uncertainty of food systems and markets, has led to a worsening of inequality, as poorer families with dwindling incomes further alter their diets to choose cheaper, less nutritious foods. making nutritious foods affordable and accessible  more than 350 million people in the asia and the pacific were undernourished in 2019, or roughly half of the global total. across the region, an estimated 74.5 million children under 5 years of age were stunted (too short for their age) and 31.5 million suffered from wasting (too thin for height). the majority of these children live in southern asia with nearly 56 million stunted and more than 25 million wasted. at the same time, overweight and obesity has increased rapidly, especially in south-eastern asia and the pacific, with an estimated 14.5 million children under 5, being overweight or obese. poor diets and inadequate nutritional intake is an ongoing problem. the cost of a healthy diet is significantly higher than that of a diet that provides sufficient calories but lacks in nutritional value, showing significant gaps in the food system to deliver nutritious options to all at an affordable price. these costs are even greater for women and children, given their added nutritional needs. the report calls for a transformation of food systems in asia and the pacific, with an aim to increase the affordability of, and families' access to, nutritious, safe, and sustainable diets. nutritious and healthy diets need to be accessible to everyone, everywhere. to ensure that happens, the report recommends integrated approaches and policies are needed. these steps are vital to overcome unaffordability issues, and also to ensure healthy maternal and child diets. improving maternal and child diets requires strengthening vital systems  nutrition is vitally important throughout a person's life. the impact of a poor diet is most severe in the first 1000 days, from pregnancy to when a child reaches the age of 2. young children, especially when they start eating their ""first foods"" at 6 months, have high nutritional requirements to grow well and every bite counts. mainstreaming nutrition-focused behaviour change campaigns throughout these systems should lead to greater knowledge uptake and sustainability of behaviours helping people to achieve healthy diets. education on what constitutes a healthy diet and how to create hygienic environments at home, in schools and in the community, together with investment in girl's education and infrastructure that underlies good water, sanitation and hygiene practices, are critical.  therefore, providing a nutritious, safe, affordable and sustainable diet for all requires coordinating with partners in the food, water and sanitation, health, social protection and education systems, to collectively create an enabling environment. greater attention is also needed to operationalize national policies and plans to improve the delivery of health services for maternal and child diets and good nutrition outcomes. services to improve the diets of mothers and young children should be prioritized as part of the essential package of health services needed to address undernutrition, overweight and obesity and to achieve universal health coverage.  in the meantime, social protection efforts can protect and stabilize incomes and improve access to healthy diets during disasters and crises. at least nine governments in asia and pacific have established a targeted mother and child covid-19 component in their social protection systems. however, more data collection and analysis are needed to document the effectiveness of social protection in improving maternal and child diets in the region. bringing everyone to the table food systems play a critical role in achieving food and nutrition security for all. a sustainable and nutrition-sensitive food system is essential to produce diverse and nutritious foods for healthy diets. improved efficiency and productivity of value chains can reduce the costs of essential foods to make them more affordable.  these actions are needed now more than ever because the face of malnutrition is changing in asia and the pacific, with highly processed and inexpensive foods readily available throughout the region. these foods are often packed with sugar and unhealthy fats and lack the vitamins and minerals required for growth and development. consumption of these foods increases the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. governments need to invest in nutrition and food safety in fresh and street food markets to promote healthy diets. regulation of sales and marketing of food for consumers, especially children, is important to curb overweight, obesity and related diseases and illness.   the report also calls for action within the private sector, as it has an important role to play in supporting the transformation of the food system and its value chains for achieving healthy diets.  leveraging these systems, in a coordinated fashion that expands the opportunities to address barriers to accessing and consuming healthy diets, will help countries and the people of asia and the pacific recover faster from the economic impact of covid-19, and be better prepared for future crises.",2021-04-16

""the resources - intellectual, financial and material - are not lacking, but unless we are well-organized and coordinated, the probability is that we will be too late and too ineffective for too many people in the least developed countries, the land-locked developing countries and the small island developing states"", he noted. the director-general stressed that actions should be taken not only towards improving production, but also creating conditions for people to consume healthy foods, which requires integrated actions by all stakeholders at local, national, regional, and global levels, and across multiple fronts - not only in agriculture, but also in many other sectors such as trade, health, environment, education and infrastructure. he singled out three critical drivers: (i) supporting countries, especially the least developed ones, to strengthen their resilience, first and foremost through increased investment;  (ii) shifting agricultural policies towards  sustainable production of more healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables and fish, as well as aquaculture products, rather than high quantities of staple foods like rice, wheat, and maize;  (iii) implementing innovations and digital technologies in agri-food systems to increase agricultural productivity sustainably and integrate smallholders into markets. qu also highlighted the importance of food loss and waste reduction as the key element ""that will allow us to improve food security and nutrition, improve the use of natural resources, and reduce environmental pressures"". high-level participants  in her address, queen máxima of the netherlands noted that many smallholder farmers were not well connected to value chains and had limited knowledge about options to access financial services, highlighting the great potential of new technologies and innovations in supporting better agricultural finance and nutrition outcomes. for her part, queen mathilde of belgium stressed that in many rural societies in developing countries women were key players in food production and processing and main agents of family well-being. however, their rights to land and financial resources remain limited and their nutrition needs are often neglected. she called for greater consideration for women's work, better mutual respect and better division of labour to correct these injustices.  princess maha chakri sirindhorn of thailand in her video address reminded the audience that approximately one-third of food produced for human consumption was lost or wasted globally every year, adversely affecting food security, nutrition, well-being, livelihood, global economy, and the environment. she called for strategies and actions to reduce food loss and waste to be urgently implemented throughout the food value chain at all levels from individual household to community, national and global levels involving farmers, food processors, food services and businesses. au commissioner josefa leonel correia sacko said that covid-19 had exposed the fragility of the african food systems in accessing safe and nutritious food at affordable price. at the same time, she noted that covid-19 also gave us an opportunity to ""build back better and greener"".  this, however, requires deploying more scientific innovation, reducing post-harvest loss, investment in research as well as creating opportunities for young people and women in agri-food systems, she added.  in her remarks, the first lady of chile, cecilia morel stressed the need to address the problem of overweight and obesity that is leading to increasing levels of non-communicable diseases and an increasing burden on our healthcare systems. to this end, she underscored the need for public policies promoting the consumption of fruits and vegetables with a focus on access of the most vulnerable populations to healthy foods.  the first lady of colombia, maria juliana ruiz in her video address stated that in order to tackle the multiple challenges posed by the pandemic, hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, we needed urgent action and a solidarity-based approach to transform our agri-food systems that is also aimed at achieving  sustainability, which must go hand in hand with fulfilling 2030 agenda's commitments. panel of experts  the event also included three different technical panels of experts.  fao chief economist máximo torero delivered one of the keynote speeches and stressed that ""we need to link recovery plans with catalytic investments and investment with significant returns on reduction of undernourishment to achieve sdg 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger) and 10 (reduced inequalities)."" panellists agreed that the impacts of covid-19 on agri-food systems have been so damaging because they are not functional, and this needs to be addressed at all levels. the panelists also highlighted the need to put the problem of healthy diets high on the political agenda and cited a shift of public procurement policies towards healthier products and subsidizing the production of healthy food as possible political incentives. another aspect mentioned was raising awareness among consumers about the impacts of unbalanced diets on their health and well-being.  time to take action in his closing remarks, the fao director-general called on participants to move from discussions to implementing policies and taking concrete actions. he alluded to the importance of political commitment and reinforced the need of working together by breaking silos and designing strategies more holistically, involving all key stakeholders such as ngos, civil society, academia and the private sector.  he also mentioned the importance of increasing production, while developing a green economy, providing access to training, education and applied science as well as empowering women and youth as key elements of achieving agri-food systems transformation, highlighting that decisions should be taken based on science and evidence. the video recording of the special seminar on food and nutrition is available here.",2021-04-16

""agriculture is a crucial sector. it accounts for more than 25 percent of gdp, as well as for more than 40 percent of employment in many countries involved in the initiative,"" he said in beijing on sunday. graziano da silva made the remarks at the belt and road forum for international cooperation. the event, he said, provided a unique impetus for an international concerted effort to promote ""a more balanced, equitable and inclusive development along the belt and road"". leaders from 29 countries were participating in the may 14-15 forum which, under the initiative called ""one belt, one road"", focuses on expanding development and trade links between asia, africa, south america and europe, as mentioned by the chinese president xi jinping in his opening remarks. the fao director-general underscored that agriculture is not only important for generating and promoting sustainable livelihoods, but it is essential for ensuring food and nutrition security, preserving natural resources and biodiversity, and for promoting rural development. fao has been the first international organization to develop a specific framework to reinforce policy coordination in the implementation of the belt and road initiative with relation to the agriculture sector. the framework seeks to promote four flagship programmes: i) one health approach for sustainable agriculture and trade; ii) sustainable food production and value chain development; iii) science and technology for agri-food innovation to combat climate-change; and iv) smart agriculture and information and communications technology (ict) application in the food industry. china - a leading role in south-south cooperation the belt and road, according to the fao director-general, opens a ""great opportunity"" among all countries involved to engage in south-south cooperation, a fao-promoted model of development which has proven effective in creating jobs, building infrastructure and promoting trade among developing countries across the ""global south"". ""let me take this opportunity to thank the chinese government for playing a leading role in the support of fao's south-south cooperation programme. it has benefitted over 30 countries and produced strong impacts in developing countries,"" graziano da silva said. president xi's keynote speech indicated that china will provide an additional one billion us dollars to support international organizations to implement a series of projects to benefit countries along the belt and road. this will allow linking the overseas development assistance already provided with policy advice, trade and long-term investments, which is what is particularly relevant for developing countries' deprived rural areas.",2021-04-16
"109","World deforestation decreases, but remains alarming in many countries","http://www.fao.org/forestry/static/data/fra2010/KeyFindings-en.pdf, http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/fra2010/en/","25 march 2010, rome - world deforestation, mainly the conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land, has decreased over the past ten years but continues at an alarmingly high rate in many countries, fao announced today. globally, around 13 million hectares of forests were converted to other uses or lost through natural causes each year between 2000 and 2010 as compared to around 16 million hectares per year during the 1990s, according to key findings of fao's most comprehensive forest review to date the global forest resources assessment 2010. the study covers 233 countries and areas. brazil and indonesia, which had the highest loss of forests in the 1990s, have significantly reduced their deforestation rates. in addition, ambitious tree planting programmes in countries such as china, india, the united states and viet nam - combined with natural expansion of forests in some regions - have added more than seven million hectares of new forests annually. as a result the net loss of forest area was reduced to 5.2 million hectares per year between 2000 and 2010, down from 8.3 million hectares annually in the 1990s. the world's total forest area is just over four billion hectares or 31 percent of the total land area. the net annual loss of forests (when the sum of all gains in forest area is smaller than all losses) in 2000-2010 is equivalent to an area about the size of costa rica.  biggest losses in south america, africasouth america and africa had the highest net annual loss of forests in 2000-2010, with four and 3.4 million hectares respectively. oceania also registered a net loss, due partly to severe drought in australia since 2000.  asia, on the other hand, registered a net gain of some 2.2 million hectares annually in the last decade, mainly because of large-scale afforestation programmes in china, india and viet nam, which have expanded their forest area by a total of close to four million hectares annually in the last five years. however, conversion of forested lands to other uses continued at high rates in many countries.  in north and central america, the forest area remained fairly stable, while in europe it continued to expand, although at a slower rate than previously.""for the first time, we are able to show that the rate of deforestation has decreased globally as a result of concerted efforts taken both at local and international level,"" said eduardo rojas, assistant director-general of fao's forestry department. ""not only have countries improved their forest policies and legislation, they have also allocated forests for use by local communities and indigenous peoples and for the conservation of biological diversity and other environmental functions. this is a very welcoming message in 2010 - the international year of biodiversity. ""however, the rate of deforestation is still very high in many countries and the area of primary forest - forests undisturbed by human activity - continues to decrease, so countries must further strengthen their efforts to better conserve and manage them"", he added. forests and climate changeforests play an important part in climate change mitigation. forests store a vast amount of carbon. when a forest is cut down and converted to another use, carbon is released back into the atmosphere. ""a lower deforestation rate and the establishment of new forests have helped bring down the high level of carbon emissions from forests caused by deforestation and forest degradation"", said mette løyche wilkie, the coordinator of the assessment. ""but we need to look forward because the large tree planting programmes in china, india and viet nam, accounting for most of the recent gains in forest area, are scheduled to end by 2020,"" she added. ""that means we have a short window of opportunity to put in place effective and permanent measures to significantly reduce the current rates of deforestation and forest degradation. without such interventions we risk a sudden return to the high rates of net forest loss and of carbon emissions from forests, which we had in the 1990s,"" she said.fao's global forest resources assessments are published every five years. more than 900 specialists from 178 countries were involved in the global forest resources assessment 2010. the full report of this assessment will be released in october 2010.key findings other key findings in the report included:brazil lost an average of 2.6 million hectares of forest annually in the last ten years as compared with 2.9 million hectares per year in the 1990s while indonesia's figures were respectively 0.5 and 1.9 million hectares per year. primary forests account for 36 percent of total forest area but have decreased by more than 40 million ha since 2000. this is largely due to reclassification of primary forest to ""other naturally regenerated forests"" because of selective logging or other human interventions. the area of forest in national parks, wilderness areas and other legally protected areas has increased by more than 94 million hectares since 1990 and it now equals 13 percent of the total forest area.forests are among the world's chief carbon sinks. they store some 289 gigatonnes (gt) of carbon in trees and vegetation. the carbon stored in forest biomass, deadwood, litter and soil together is more than all the carbon in the atmosphere. globally, carbon stocks in forest biomass decreased by an estimated 0.5 gt a year in 2000-2010, mainly due to a reduction in total forest area.fires, pests and diseases are causing increased damage to forests in some countries. on average, one percent of all forests was reported to be significantly affected each year by forest fires. outbreaks of forest insects damage some 35 million hectares of forest annually. extreme weather events such as storms, blizzards and earthquakes also took a heavy toll in the past decade.seventy-six countries have issued or updated their forest policies since 2000 and 69 countries - primarily in europe and africa - have enacted or amended their forest laws since 2005.data collection for the global forest resources assessment is becoming more comprehensive and precise. new data and additional information on afforestation and on natural expansion of forests for the past 20 years has made it possible to estimate rates of deforestation and loss from natural causes more accurately. the new global estimate for 1990 to 2000 (close to 16 million ha per year) is higher than previously estimated (13 million ha), because it now also includes deforestation within countries that have had an overall net gain in forest area.a remote-sensing survey of forests, led by fao, sampling some 13 500 sites over a period of 15 years, will provide even more accurate data on global and regional rates of deforestation by the end of 2011.",2021-04-16

fao special goodwill ambassadors for nutrition; un's secretary general; and the heads of ifad and wfp.saluting fao's anniversary, pope francis described the organization's mission as ""beautiful and important"".time to build back betterworld food day is marked this year as global hunger rises for the fifth consecutive year and a healthy diet is out of reach for 3 billion people. nearly 700 million people still go hungry, and the pandemic could tip up to 132 million more into hunger by the end of 2020.this year's world food day aims to galvanize and accelerate action towards ending hunger and malnutrition in all its forms, and to make food and agriculture an essential part of the covid-19 response.chief amongst them, as speakers at today's event noted, are global solidarity and building more resilient, robust agri-food systems that can withstand shocks, deliver affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all, and decent livelihoods for all workers along the food supply chain.  ""now is the time to rethink our approaches and redouble our efforts,"" said qu.amongst these, qu highlighted pioneering sciences and technologies, stressing that ""innovation is our ally in re-imagining our food systems and ending hunger, as we are morally and politically bound to do in the next ten years"".pope francis urged for more support for fao's and all un food agencies' initiatives that promote sustainable and diversified agriculture, and support small farming communities and the rural development of the poorest countries.using the money that buys arms and covers military expenses for defeating hunger and rural development instead would also be a ""courageous decision"", said the pope.""hunger is not merely a disaster for humanity but also a disgrace... we cannot fail to respond or to act. we all are responsible,"" said pope francis.his words were echoed by un's secretary-general antónio guterres who called for intensified efforts to achieve the vision of sustainable development goals - ""a future where everyone everywhere has access to the nutrition they need"". to inspire action towards this vision, guterres said, he will convene a food systems summit next year.noting that his country was proud to host fao's headquarters, italy's president sergio mattarella said he welcomed fao's and its director-general's ""commitment to work with italy and many other countries in forging a ""food coalition"" aimed at containing the effects of covid-19 on food systems"".this is the moment of ""crucial choices"", and of ""a serious global commitment,"" concluded mattarella who expressed hope for the international community to rediscover a ""profound meaning of the valuable goods the earth offers us"" and the ""responsibility to share and safeguard them for future generations"".healthy diets for allfao goodwill ambassadors for nutrition, king letsie iii of lesotho and queen letizia of spain stressed that healthy diets were everyone's right.king letsie iii underlined that most of the people who cannot afford a healthy diet live in africa and asia, and called for ""concerted efforts to bring down the cost of nutritious foods"" so more people can afford them.""the nutritional status of the most vulnerable populations groups is likely to deteriorate further as a result of the destructive health and social economic impact of covid-19,"" warned king letsie iii.highlighting that hundreds of millions go hungry whilst many more suffer from obesity, queen letizia said: ""these imbalances should make us think about how to strengthen food systems, seeking shorter marketing pathways to encourage local, seasonal, sustainable and small-scale production, a strategy that would also make life easier for many women in regions of the world where their vulnerability is extreme.""the president of the international fund for agricultural development's (ifad) gilbert f. houngbo said:""we know that when crisis strikes, it is the poor and the vulnerable who suffer the most. we just cannot help but be aware of this reality and focus our attention on these most marginalized people, particularly in rural settings. at a time like this, these rural people need our support even more. but we also need them. if we want strong, healthy and peaceful societies, first we need to produce enough nutritious food for everyone.""ending wars and responding to climate extremes criticalthe world food programme (wfp) was last week awarded the 2020 nobel prize for peace, which many speakers today lauded as a recognition of hunger as a threat to peace and the need for the international community to turn its attention to addressing food insecurity. david beasley, executive director of wfp said:""2021 is looking very bleak. but i believe that if we reached deep into the hearts and pockets of the people around the world, we can perform another miracle.""""but as long as we have man-made conflicts, we will never end hunger,"" warned beasley. ""it is critical that we end the wars, it is critical that we respond to climate extremes...if we strengthen the fragile governments out there, do the things we know that we have the expertise to do, i believe that we will be celebrating world food day in a way we have never done before because hunger will be at the end.""world food day events around the worldearlier today, the fao director-general participated in an online world food day event in brussels hosted by the european parliamentary alliance against hunger and malnutrition, whose continued efforts to put food and nutrition high on the political agenda, he commended. qu was joined, amongst others, by the vice-president of the european parliament, heidi hautala, and the european commissioner for agriculture, janusz wojciechowski. hautala called for globalized and systematic solutions, innovation and equity as part of efforts to build back better and end hunger. wojciechowski spoke about eu's green deal and noted the commission's covid-19 response work with fao on food security and rural development. achieving zero hunger possiblethis renewed sense of commitment and call to action today is all the more important as a joint study of fao and partners revealed this week that we could end hunger by 2030 if donors double their investments and spend the money wisely.""the scourge of hunger has been tormenting humankind for millennia. but we are the generation that can end it, once and for all,"" said fao director-general.honouring food heroesthis year's world food day also honours all food heroes, who - despite all difficulties - continue to provide food to their communities and beyond.today, fao and its partners are urging everyone to show gratitude for the food we eat and the people who produce, plant, harvest, fish or transport it.events in over 150 countries, including at rome's colosseum that is serving as a stunning backdrop for an fao video mapping show this evening, mark world food day and celebrate the world's food heroes and fao's anniversary.",2021-04-16
"112","How to overcome water challenges in agriculture","https://doi.org/10.4060/cb1447en, http://www.fao.org/3/t0800e/t0800e.pdf","26 november 2020, rome - more than three billion people live in agricultural areas with high to very high levels of water shortages and scarcity, and almost half of them face severe constraints. furthermore, available freshwater resources per person have declined by more than 20 percent over the past two decades globally, underscoring the importance of producing more with less, especially in the agriculture sector, the world's largest user of water.improved water management, supported by effective governance and strong institutions - including secure water tenure and rights, underpinned by sound water accounting and auditing - will be essential to ensure global food security and nutrition, and contribute to the sustainable development goals (sdgs), according to the state of food and agriculture (sofa) 2020 - a flagship report published today by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations.""with this report, fao is sending a strong message: water shortages and scarcity in agriculture must be addressed immediately and boldly,"" fao director-general qu dongyu said while presenting the report. ""water is essential, not only for agriculture but for livelihoods and civilizations to continue.""paths for action range from investing in water-harvesting and conservation in rainfed areas to rehabilitating and modernizing sustainable irrigation systems in irrigated areas. these must be combined with best agronomic practices, such as adopting drought-tolerant crop varieties, and improved water management tools - including effective water pricing and allocation tools, such as water rights and quotas - to ensure equitable and sustainable access. water accounting and auditing must be, however, the starting point for any effective management strategy.achieving the internationally agreed sdg pledges, including the zero hunger target (sdg 2), ""is still achievable,"" the sofa emphasizes - but only by ensuring more productive and sustainable use of freshwater and rainwater in agriculture, which accounts for more than 70 percent of global water withdrawals.fao's sofa report in 1993 also focused on water issues, and today it is striking how the findings presented then remain valid and relevant today. while the previous report focused on irrigation, the new edition broadens its scope to cover water-related challenges in rainfed agriculture, which represents more than 80 percent of land under cultivation and 60 percent of global crop production. mapping the moisturefao is the custodian of sdg indicator 6.4.2, which measures the pressure of human activities on natural freshwater resources, and sofa offers the first spatially disaggregated representation of how things stand today - which, when meshed with historical drought frequency data, allows for a more holistic assessment of water constraints in food production. about 1.2 billion people - 44 percent of them in rural areas and the remainder in small urban centers in the countryside - live in places where severe water shortages and scarcity challenge agriculture. around 40 percent of them live in eastern and south-eastern asia, and a slightly higher share in southern asia. central asia and northern africa and western asia are also severely affected - about one of every five people live in agricultural areas with very high water shortages and scarcity, compared to less than 4 percent in europe, latin america and the caribbean, northern america and oceania. about 5 percent of people living in sub-saharan africa live in similar conditions, meaning that about 50 million people live in areas where severe drought has catastrophic impacts on cropland and pastureland once every three years. about 11 percent of the world's rainfed cropland, or 128 million hectares, face frequent drought, as does about 14 percent of pastureland, or 656 million hectares. meanwhile, more than 60 percent (or 171 million hectares) of irrigated cropland is highly water stressed. 11 countries, all in northern africa and asia, face both challenges, making it urgent and necessary to adopt sound water accounting, clear allocation, modern technologies and to shift to less thirsty crops. mathematics of water""the inherent characteristics of water make it difficult to manage,"" the sofa report notes. ""water should be recognized as an economic good that has a value and a price,"" it says - a point emphasized by the director-general - noting that customary practices leading it to be treated as a free commodity often create market failures. a price that reflects the true value of water, by contrast, sends a clear signal to users to use water wisely. at the same time, policy and governance support to ensure efficient, equitable and sustainable access for all is essential.three main points of entry for action are in the technical and management arena, in institutions and legal frameworks, and the overall policy environment, said fao chief economist maximo torero during the virtual event to launch the report.  ""strengthening trust between actors is central,"" he added, noting that a robust and shared data base on water availability can facilitate reaching agreements on required trade-offs. ""water management plans need to be problem-focused and dynamic,"" the report recommends. sofa notes that the rural poor can benefit substantially from irrigation and endorses its cautious expansion. between 2010 and 2050, harvested irrigated areas are projected to grow in most regions of the world and to more than double in sub-saharan africa, potentially benefiting hundreds of millions of rural people.the report notes that, in some cases, small-scale and farmer-led irrigation systems can be more efficient than large-scale projects. that's a promising path for sub-saharan africa, where surface and underground water resources are comparatively undeveloped and only 3 percent of cropland is equipped for irrigation - and where expanding small-scale irrigation can be profitable and benefit millions of rural people. however, many factors impede adoption, including lack of secure water tenure and access to finance and credit. in asia, declining large-scale state-funded surface irrigation have led to farmers tapping directly into groundwater, placing excessive pressure on the resource. addressing these issues will require investing in modernizing old irrigation schemes, as well as effective policies.full-fledged water markets involving the sale of water rights are relatively rare. however, when water accounting and auditing is well performed, water tenure and rights are well established, and the active participation of beneficiaries and managing institutions is promoted, regulated water markets can induce efficient and equitable allocation of water, while promoting its conservation.guest speakers at today's launch event, mohammed ait kadi, president of morocco's general council of agricultural development, and david zilberman, professor at the university of california, berkeley, both expressed support for the sofa recommendations, with the latter underscoring the need for pricing mechanisms and the former calling for strategies to achieve ""more food security per drop of water.""robust calculations of water footprints should be developed and used, leveraging the process of developing the carbon footprint concept, fao chief scientist ismahane elouafi said in her concluding remarks. did you know? -the average amount of freshwater per person in 2017 was about 43 000 m3 in oceania, while barely reaching 1 000 m3 in northern africa and western asia.  -total water withdrawals per capita are highest in central asia, reaching almost 2 000 m3 per person in 2017, compared to less than 130 m3 in sub-saharan africa.  -in least developed countries, 74 percent of rural people do not have access to safe drinking water. 91 countries have national plans for rural drinking water, but only nine have allocated sufficient funding to implement them. -around 41 percent of current global irrigation occurs at the expense of environmental flow requirements, which are essential to sustain ecosystems that provide life-supporting functions. -biofuels require 70 to 400 times more water than do the fossil fuels they replace. -major forests in areas such as the amazon, congo and yangtze river basins are important sources of water vapour for areas downwind and are, therefore, crucial to rainfed agriculture.",2021-04-16
"113","Closing the gender gap in agriculture","http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2050e/i2050e00.htm","7 march 2011, rome - if women in rural areas had the same access to land, technology, financial services, education and markets as men, agricultural production could be increased and the number of hungry people reduced by 100-150 million, fao said today in its 2010-11 edition of the state of food and agriculture report.yields on plots managed by women are lower than those managed by men, the report said. but this is not because women are worse farmers than men. they simply do not have the same access to inputs. if they did, their yields would go up, they would produce more and overall agricultural production would increase, the report said.  ""the report makes a powerful business case for promoting gender equality in agriculture,"" said fao director-general jacques diouf. ""gender equality is not just a lofty ideal, it is also crucial for agricultural development and food security. we must promote gender equality and empower women in agriculture to win, sustainably, the fight against hunger and extreme poverty,"" he added. closing yield gaps reaps gains for all just giving women the same access as men to agricultural resources could increase production on women's farms in developing countries by 20 to 30 percent. this could raise total agricultural production in developing countries by 2.5 to 4 percent, which could in turn reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12 to 17 percent, or 100 to 150 million people. an estimated 925 million people in the world were undernourished in 2010, of which 906 million live in developing countries. ""we must eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, ensure that access to resources is more equal and that agricultural policies and programmes are gender-aware, and make women's voices heard in decision-making at all levels. women must be seen as equal partners in sustainable development,"" diouf said. women's workwomen make up on average 43 percent of the agricultural labour force in developing countries, ranging from 20% in latin america to almost 50% in east and southeast asia and sub-saharan africa. the share is higher in some countries and varies greatly within countries.where rural women are employed, they tend to be segregated into lower paid occupations and are more likely to be in less secure forms of employment, such as seasonal, part-time or low-wage jobs. new jobs in high-value export-oriented agro-industries offer better opportunities for women than traditional agriculture, the report says.mind the gapthe report documents gender gaps in the access to a wide range of agricultural resources, including land, livestock, farm labour, education, extension services, credit, fertilizers and mechanical equipment.women in all regions generally have less access to land than men. for those developing countries for which data are available, between 3 and 20 percent of all landholders are women. the share of women in the agricultural labour force is much higher and ranges from 20 to 50 percent in developing country regions.  ""women farmers typically achieve lower yields than men, not because they are less skilled, but because they operate smaller farms and use fewer inputs like fertilizers, improved seeds and tools,"" said terri raney, editor of the sofa report. leveling the ploughing field""evidence from many countries shows that policies can promote gender equality and empower women in agriculture and rural employment. the first priority is to eliminate discrimination under the law,"" raney said. ""in many countries women do not have the same rights as men to buy, sell or inherit land, to open a savings account or borrow money, to sign a contract or sell their produce. where legal rights exist on paper, they often are not honored in practice.""government officials must be held accountable for upholding the law and women must be aware of their rights and empowered to claim them.women face multiple constraints in agriculture arising from the complex nature of agricultural production and from competing demands on their time. to be effective, interventions must be ""bundled"" so they treat these constraints together, the report says.policies and institutions often have different impacts on men and women - even when no explicit discrimination is intended. ""men and women have different roles in society and face different opportunities and constraints,"" said raney. ""we can't make good agricultural policy unless we consider gender differences.""building human capitalin addition to increasing overall agricultural production, closing the gender gap in agriculture would also put more income in the hands of women - a proven strategy for improving health, nutrition and education outcomes for children. ""one of the best investments we can make is in building the human capital of women and girls - basic education, market information and agricultural extension services are essential building blocks for agricultural productivity and economic growth,"" raney said.",2021-04-16

""we all share a common goal - the sustainable management of our valuable aquatic resources,"" semedo said. ""this is vital to having better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life for all so that, together, we can achieve the sustainable development goals."" the declaration builds upon existing international instruments aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries and aquaculture around the world, such as the landmark fao code of conduct for responsible fisheries, recognizing successes since the endorsement of the code and identifying new and urgent priorities.  cofi34 marked the 25th anniversary of the code with a high-level special event. since its adoption in 1995, the fao code of conduct for responsible fisheries has been the main instrument for developing international agreements, guidelines and tools to ensure the effective conservation, management, utilization and production of living aquatic resources.in 2018, global fisheries and aquaculture production (excluding aquatic plants) reached an all-time record of nearly 179 million tonnes. overall capture fisheries, with 96.4 million tonnes represented 54 percent of the total, while aquaculture, with 82.1 million tonnes, accounted for 46 percent. the 2020 state of world fisheries and aquaculture (sofia) report estimates that total fish production is set to increase to 204 million tonnes in 2030, up 15 percent from 2018, with aquaculture's share growing from its current 46 percent to 53 percent. aquaculture has been the fastest expanding food production sector globally over the last decades, growing at an average of 5.3 percent per year since the turn of the century. fao estimates that 34.2 percent of all marine fish stocks are fished beyond biological sustainable limits, a threefold increase since monitoring started in 1974.  iuu fishing at cofi34, members acknowledged the need for greater monitoring and transparency in fishing operations, and noted further efforts were needed to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (iuu) fishing. countries were urged to become a party to the fao agreement on port state measure (psma), considered a potent international instrument to combat iuu fishing. during cofi34, the russian federation announced it was becoming a party to the psma, joining another 68 fao members including the european union on behalf of its member states, which have adhered to the agreement since its adoption in 2009.  earlier this year, the united kingdom also agreed to become a party to the agreement, following its departure from the eu. fao confirmed that it would be further strengthening its $20 million global capacity development programme to support countries in enhancing their capacity to implement the psma and complementary international instruments.   covid-19 response cofi members also requested that fao supports fisherfolk communities affected by the pandemic through its covid19 response and recovery programme . the covid-19 pandemic has affected the fisheries and aquaculture sector through changing consumer demands, market access and logistical problems related to transportation and border restrictions.  the report the impact of covid-19 on fisheries and aquaculture food systems, featured during the cofi34, showed that fish supply, consumption and trade revenues for 2020 are all expected to have declined due to containment restrictions, while global aquaculture production is expected to fall by some 1.3 per cent, the first fall recorded by the sector in several years. the report also noted that global fisheries and aquaculture could face further disruption in 2021 as lockdowns affect supply and demand across the sector. cofi34 recognised the importance of the sustainable use of aquatic resources for biodiversity conservation. in addition, the meeting stressed the crucial need to improve data collection in the fisheries sector to support evidence-based decision making, especially in support of small-scale fishers, whose critical role will be celebrated during the international year of artisanal fisheries and aquaculture in 2022.  fao is working with duke university and worldfish, a non-profit research organization, to assess the economic, environmental and social contribution of small-scale fisheries to food security, nutrition and development at global level. the next cofi session (cofi35) will be held from september 5-9 in 2022. the committee is the only global inter-governmental forum where fao members meet to consider issues and challenges facing fisheries and aquaculture.  fisheries and aquaculture will also be discussed at the world ocean summit in march, as well as the un climate change conference (cop26) in november and in the un biodiversity conference (cop15) in december.",2021-04-16

""fao and our partners are committed to remaining engaged and involved in supporting those efforts."" buyers from saudi arabia, yemen, oman, kuwait qatar and united arab emirates have all taken advantage of somalia's thriving livestock scene and its improved disease surveillance and control mechanisms. saudi arabia, in particular, has contributed to steadily rising exports over the last six years, following a move to lift a 9-year ban on the import of livestock from somalia aimed at preventing the spread of rift valley fever. return on investments for the last five years, fao, with financial support from the european union and the uk government, has engaged with the somali government to invest heavily in livestock infrastructure, fodder production and livestock vaccination and treatment services. transboundary animal diseases have been a major point of attention because they can kill large numbers of animals, resulting in food shortages, market disruptions and trade and export barriers. every year, fao vaccinates an average of 12 million animals in somalia against peste des petits ruminants (ppr)  a highly contagious and often deadly viral disease of goats. another 12 million goats are treated and vaccinated every year against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (ccpp), a source of major losses among somali livestock producers.  in addition to animal health campaigns, four modern slaughterhouses, four meat markets and three livestock markets are also boosting local livestock trade across somalia.  there is no doubt that livestock is, and will remain for a long time, central to the somali economy, said trenchard.  continued investment in building somali livestock institutions is key to boosting incomes, reducing the vulnerability of rural households, and steering the future growth of the sector, according to trenchard, who says the livestock sector is at a tipping point. an investment in livestock means an investment in economic growth for the whole of somalia, he said added value from by-products with trade of live animals booming, fao is now working with the somali government and partners to identify other opportunities to derive added value from livestock by-products. in 2012, under a uk-funded initiative, somali pastoralists were trained in soap manufacturing using camel bone marrow and trained jewelers carved spoons, necklaces and flower vases out of the dense bones. in may 2015, fao will start training 150 somalis in curing leather, a potentially lucrative opportunity for the entire livestock sector, while an eu-funded programme is currently underway to improve milk quality in northwestern somalia, one of the countrys main milk production regions.  the 2014 figures represent an optimum level of live animal export for somalia, according to fao experts, who urge producers to shift focus towards export of meat and other by-products.   a livestock certification system developed by fao along the galkayo-bossaso livestock corridor will further help to ensure high quality livestock for local consumption and export.",2021-04-16

""the near-achievement of the mdg hunger targets shows us that we can indeed eliminate the scourge of hunger in our lifetime. we must be the zero hunger generation. that goal should be mainstreamed into all policy interventions and at the heart of the new sustainable development agenda to be established this year,"" said fao director general josé graziano da silva. ""if we truly wish to create a world free from poverty and hunger, then we must make it a priority to invest in the rural areas of developing countries where most of the world's poorest and hungriest people live,"" said ifad president kanayo f. nwanze. ""we must work to create a transformation in our rural communities so they provide decent jobs, decent conditions and decent opportunities. we must invest in rural areas so that our nations can have balanced growth and so that the three billion people who live in rural areas can fulfil their potential."" ""men, women and children need nutritious food every day to have any chance of a free and prosperous future. healthy bodies and minds are fundamental to both individual and economic growth, and that growth must be inclusive for us to make hunger history,"" said wfp executive director ertharin cousin.striking advances, given challenging environmentprogress towards fully achieving the 2015 food security targets was hampered in recent years by challenging global economic conditions. extreme weather events, natural disasters, political instability and civil strife have all impeded progress  24 african countries currently face food crises, twice as many as in 1990; around one of every five of the world's undernourished lives in crisis environments characterized by weak governance and acute vulnerability to death and disease. sofi 2015 notes that over the past 30 years crises have evolved from catastrophic, short-term, acute and highly visible events to protracted situations, due to a combination of factors, especially natural disasters and conflicts, with climate change, financial and price crises frequently among the exacerbating factors.hunger rates in countries enduring protracted crises are more than three times higher than elsewhere. in 2012 some 366 million people were living in this kind situation  of whom 129 million were undernourished  19 percent of all food-insecure people on the planet.yet, alongside these challenges, the world population has grown by 1.9 billion since 1990, making reductions of the number of hungry people all the more striking, the report says.bright lights and darker shadows on the hunger maplarge reductions in hunger were achieved in east asia and very fast progress was posted in latin america and the caribbean, southeast and central asia, as well as some parts of africa, showing that inclusive economic growth, agricultural investments and social protection, along with political stability makes the elimination of hunger possible.  above all, the political will to make hunger eradication a paramount development objective has fostered progress. sub-saharan africa is the region with the highest prevalence of undernourishment in the world  at 23.2 percent, or almost one in every four people. however, african nations that invested more in improving agricultural productivity and basic infrastructure also achieved their mdg hunger target, notably in west africa. the proportion of hungry people in latin america and the caribbean has dropped from 14.7 percent to 5.5 percent since 1990, while the share of underweight children (below 5 years of age) also declined sharply. a strong commitment to hunger reduction was translated into substantial social protection programmes which, coupled with strong economic growth, drove continent-wide progress. diverse trends were observed in different parts of asia. countries in eastern and southeast asia have achieved steady and rapid reduction in both malnourishment indicators, buoyed by investment in water and sanitation infrastructure as well as favourable economic prospects.in southern asia, the prevalence of undernourishment has declined modestly, to 15.7 percent from 23.9 percent, but much greater progress was made in reducing underweight among young children.severe food insecurity is close to being eradicated in north africa, with the prevalence of undernourishment below 5 percent, while dietary quality is of growing concern in the region, where there is a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity.in west asia, where hygiene conditions are generally advanced and child underweight rates low, the incidence of hunger has risen due to war, civil strife and consequent large migrant and refugee populations in some countries. lessons from the mdgs experience while there is no one-size-fits-all solution for how to improve food security, the sofi report outlines several factors that played a critical role in achieving the hunger target. first, improved agricultural productivity, especially by small and family farmers, leads to important gains in hunger and poverty reduction. high performers on that front in africa met the mdg hunger target while those that made slower progress did not. second, while economic growth is always beneficial, not least because it expands the fiscal revenue base necessary to fund social transfers and other assistance programmes, it needs to be inclusive to help reduce hunger. inclusive growth provides a proven avenue for those with fewer assets and skills in boosting their incomes, and providing them the resilience they need to weather natural and man-made shocks.  raising the productivity of family farmers is an effective way out of poverty and hunger. third, the expansion of social protection  often cash transfers to vulnerable households, but also food vouchers, health insurance or school meal programs, perhaps linked to guaranteed procurement contracts with local farmers  correlated strongly with progress in hunger reduction and in assuring that all members of society have the healthy nutrition to pursue productive lives.some 150 million people worldwide are prevented from falling into extreme poverty thanks to social protection, according to sofi  but more than two-thirds of the world's poor still do not have access to regular and predictable forms of social support. transfers help households manage risk and mitigate shocks that would otherwise leave them trapped in poverty and hunger.the full state of food insecurity in the world 2015 report is available online, here.  regional perspectives on hungerfao will also be releasing a series of companion reports following the sofi launch, which will look more closely at regional hunger trends. the calendar for presentation of these regional overviews is as follows: 28 may: asia and the pacific (to be released from bangkok); latin america and the caribbean (santiago de chile) 2 june: africa

""soil acts as a filter for contaminants. but when its buffering capacity is exceeded, contaminants can enter the environment and the food chain. this undermines food security by making crops risky and unsafe for consumption"". ""human activities are the main source of soil pollution. it is in our hands to adopt sustainable soil management practices,"" she added.  she called ""for greater political support and significantly increased investment towards healthy soils"". maintaining healthy soils helps ensure safe and nutritious foods and is essential for achieving the sustainable development goals and zero hunger.  reuse, recycle and reduce this year the world soil day theme is ""be the solution to soil pollution"", and fao offers a number of recommendations on how to reduce the soil contamination at the state, industrial and consumer level.  for example, growing cities are producing mounds of garbage that end up in landfills and enter the soil, up to 80 percent of which could be recycled.  as technological progress accelerates, electronic waste is considered as a new emerging threat to soils. fifty million tons of e-waste are generated every year, making it one of the world's fastest growing pollution problems affecting our soils. fao encourages people to donate or recycle old devices rather than throwing them away.   while agrochemicals can help meet the world's growing demand for food, they leave a legacy of soil pollution and degraded agroecosystems. nearly 60 percent of the top agricultural soils in 11 european countries contain residues of multiple persistent pesticides. fao urges governments to promote the responsible and sustainable management of agrochemicals.  one third of the plastic produced globally ends up in our soils with plastic particles then entering the food chain and the environment.  stronger environmental policies and regulations are needed to prevent the use of excessive packaging and chemicals by industry. however, each and every person can also contribute to solving the problem by simply carrying a reusable bottle and grocery bag, and buying products with reduced or recycled packaging. economic impact of soil loss in malawi  - new study  fao today also presented the key results of its first ever economic assessment of the impact of soil erosion and soil nutrient loss. the study which was conducted under a pilot project in malawi funded by the undp-unep poverty-environment initiative, allows for a better understanding of the economic damages incurred by soil loss.  according to the study, a 25 percent increase in soil loss in malawi would result in a reduction of gdp by 0.64 percent, which is the equivalent of about $40 million per year. ""soil degradation has high economic costs: loss of soil health leads to reduced crop yields,"" semedo said. ""preventing soil pollution must be a top priority worldwide"", she concluded.  the glinka world soil prize winner announced  during the world soil day ceremony, the glinka world soil prize 2018 was awarded to professor rattan lal, the president of the international union of soil science (iuss), for his outstanding contribution to sustainable soil management. professor lal has been listed among the world's most influential scientific minds (2012) and among the top one percent of all researchers in agriculture. his scientific work has notably contributed to soil organic carbon restoration and improvement of soil structure but also played a major role in converting science into policy and decision-making. the glinka world soil prize, named after the pioneering russian scientist konstantin d. glinka, was established by the global soil partnership with the support of the russian federation in 2016 and honours individuals and organizations whose leadership and activities have contributed to the promotion of sustainable soil management and the protection of soil resources.  this year the russian federation has also approved the financial contribution of $2 million to support the activities of the global soil partnership in its second phase (2018-2020). today, the first world soil day award was also delivered to practical action bangladesh for organizing the best world soil day celebration in 2017. the new fao-established award is funded by the kingdom of thailand.",2021-04-16

""the covid-19 pandemic poses a clear and present danger to food security and nutrition, especially to the world's most vulnerable communities"" fao director-general qu dongyu said today at the opening of a high-level un event on humanitarian action. the director-general told the virtual event that while assessments were taking place at country level as ongoing agricultural seasons unfolded, the impact of covid-19 was already being seen in some of the world's food crisis hotspots. recent data from the fao-hosted integrated food security phase classification (ipc) initiative indicates that in afghanistan, food insecurity -- already alarmingly high -- has now been aggravated by the impact of coronavirus. the latest estimates show that 10.3 million people there are now dealing with crisis levels of acute hunger or worse. the trend is similar in the central african republic, where about 2.4 million people are now facing crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity -- an 11 percent increase compared with pre-pandemic times, according to the ipc. in somalia, 3.5 million people are projected to face crisis or worse in the coming months - three times the number at the start of the year. ""we risk a looming food crisis unless measures are taken fast to protect the most vulnerable, keep the global agricultural supply chains alive, and mitigate the pandemic's impacts across the food system,"" the fao director-general said. rural women are among the most vulnerable and the first to lose their incomes, qu noted. today's humanitarian affairs segment (has) of the un's economic and social council was aimed at  reinforcing humanitarian assistance as the un marks its 75th anniversary in a context of expanding needs. it brought together un member states, un organizations, humanitarian and development partners, the private sector and affected communities. qu's message came ahead of the release of a new policy brief by un secretary-general, antonio guterres, who warned that food systems are failing the world's most vulnerable and the covid-19 pandemic was making it far worse. supporting livelihoods saves livesfao and other un agencies are concerned that covid-19's multiple impacts on economic activity and supply chains are limiting people's ability to access food,  increasingly restricting the cash liquidity of farmers, and handicapping farmers' ability to produce and market food -- which in the longer term could seriously degrade their livelihoods.  qu said local food availability was already emerging as a critical risk as many farmers had reduced income and resources to invest in the next planting season. but so far, the need to support livelihoods is largely being ignored in the response to the pandemic, he warned - although the cost benefit analysis of such interventions is positive. last year, for example, fao's emergency distribution of seeds accounted for one-quarter of the cereals produced in south sudan. without that relatively cheap investment, millions more south sudanese would now be reliant on much more costly humanitarian food assistance.responding to growing needsbefore the pandemic, 135 million people worldwide were already coping with acute hunger caused by conflict, climate shocks, and economic downturns, according to the 2020 edition of the global report on food crises, produced by fao, the european union and 13 other partners.  another 183 million were at risk of being pushed into extreme hunger if faced with an additional stressor. as part of the revised un humanitarian appeal for covid-19, fao has asked for $350 million to support a range of activities aimed at helping poor farmers continue to operate, safeguard the continuity of food supply chains and markets, and prevent the food sector from being a vector of transmission for the disease.",2021-04-16

""but because trade disruptions may be very costly and given the reported increase in the occurrence of these disruptions, fao conducted this survey and is holding a technical consultation to try to start a dialogue between countries on the issue."" ""we were surprised to see incidents from every region,"" she said. ""it seems the more testing and more monitoring they do, the more incidents they find."" ""although testing technology is more sensitive now, i would note that 37 out of 75 countries responded that they have little or no capacity to detect gmos, that is, they don't have the laboratories, technicians, and equipment to do so,"" she added. ""many countries have asked fao to help improve their capacity to detect gmos."" ""in the survey, countries also asked us to help them assess whether gm crops are safe to eat and we would like to see countries sharing any scientific findings they have on the subject,"" she said. ""for this purpose, fao established fao gm foods platform, a web page for countries to share information on safety assessment."" the platform can be accessed at http://fao.org/gm-platform/.  other survey findings include:  30 countries produce gm crops, either for research or commercial production or both, and more gm crops are being developed; 17 countries do not have any food safety, feed safety or environmental regulations on gm crops;  55 countries have zero-tolerance policy for unauthorized gm crops; 38 countries consider the different policies on gmos existing between trading partners is an important factor in contributing to the trade risk posed by the presence of low levels of gm crops in some traded foods;  in most countries, there are no generally applicable low-level gmo policies, legislation or regulations yet in place. different options have been used when setting such policy, including a zero tolerance policy, a low threshold policy and a case-by-case policy.",2021-04-16

"125","World Food Day sees call for bolder action to make healthy and sustainable diets available to all","http://www.fao.org/world-food-day","16 october 2019, rome - at the global world food day ceremony today speakers called for bolder and faster action across sectors to make healthy and sustainable diets available and affordable for all. this year's world food day - with the theme ""our actions are our future. healthy diets for a #zerohunger world"" - takes place in the context of rising global hunger but also increasing overweight and obesity. fao and its partners believe that affordable solutions to reduce all forms of malnutrition exist, but they require greater global commitment and action. ""collective action is the high road to tackling a global challenge such as hunger in the world,"" said italy's prime minister giuseppe conte in his keynote speech.  the prime minister gave reassurance of italy's support for a ""vision of integrated agriculture that supports the planet and cultural identity"", and stressed the need to understand development ""as a genuine international collaboration, as politics in the noblest sense"" to achieve the sustainable development goals (sdgs). both conte and fao director-general qu dongyu welcomed an announcement by un secretary-general antónio guterres of the convening of a un food systems summit in 2021 as part of the decade of action to deliver the sdgs. conte proposed that italy host the event, and was thanked by qu for the offer.  in a world food day video message guterres called rising hunger ""unacceptable"" as the world wastes more than 1 billion tonnes of food every year. pope francis in a special message read out at the event, stressed that the ""battle against hunger and malnutrition will not end as long as the logic of the market prevails and profit is sought at any cost"".  the pontiff urged for a cultivation of lifestyles inspired by gratitude, moderation and solidarity, and the need to promote economic institutions and social initiatives that support the poor.  ""we must come to realize that what we are accumulating and wasting is the bread of the poor,"" pope francis added. in his opening remarks, fao director-general qu dongyu warned how ""hunger and malnutrition will be major barriers to achieving the sdgs by 2030 if we do not act now!""  the fao chief stressed the importance of collaboration and the role everyone needs to play - from governments, food companies, the public sector, research institutions to consumers - to make progress towards enabling healthy diets for all, and to halt and hopefully reverse the current trend of rising hunger, overweight and obesity.   ""we need strong political will and commitment. we need to invest in nutrition and for nutrition. we need to walk hand-in-hand and build healthy and sustainable food systems,"" added the fao director-general.  the fao chief announced the un agency's biennial theme for 2020-2021 - promoting healthy diets and preventing all forms of malnutrition - and reaffirmed fao's commitment to the global goal of ending hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030. in his remarks, president of the international fund for agricultural development (ifad) gilbert f. houngbo said: ""we can reach our commitment to end hunger. our success will depend on transforming global food systems so that they are inclusive of women, youth and indigenous peoples. so that they are sustainable - environmentally, socially, and economically. and so that they contribute to healthy diets for all. with the right policies and the right investments in agricultural and rural development we can create a food secure world where both hunger and poverty are dramatically reduced."" david beasley, executive director of the world food programme (wfp) for his part echoed the call to end food waste and urged individuals around the world to join wfp's campaign to #stopthewaste: ""the amount of food wasted globally is enough to feed another 2 billion people, so in a world where every five seconds a child dies from preventable causes like hunger and malnutrition this is totally unacceptable. we have a solution to hunger in our hands, just by being better stewards of the food we already have. if we all come together, and work together, we can achieve zero hunger - but we must not rest until every child, everywhere, goes to bed with a full stomach."" sergio mattarella, italy's president sent a message a support, highlighting that ""food insecurity is certainly one of the worst consequences of climate change"".  ministers from several countries also spoke at the event - a testimony of the importance of making healthy diets accessible and affordable for all.   they were: edward francisco centeno gadea minister for agriculture of nicaragua, kassoum denon minister commissioner for food security of mali, elina kalkku vice minister, development policy, ministry for foreign affairs of finland, and mariam bint saeed hareb al mehairi minister of state for food security of the united arab emirates. joaquim josé gusmão dos reis martins minister for agriculture and fisheries of timor-leste sent a message of support. making the case for healthy and sustainable diets  during his remarks, the fao director-general stressed that there are over 820 million hungry people in the world. he noted however, that while the total number of those chronically undernourished has been increasing in recent years, the rate is decreasing compared to total population of the planet.    qu also underscored that over 2 billion adults, and nearly 380 million children and adolescents, are overweight or obese. this is because our current food systems are failing to ensure food security for all and deliver on healthy diets whilst contributing to environmental degradation.  from agricultural production to processing and retailing, there is little space for fresh, locally produced foods as high-yielding and profitable crops take priority.  although enough food is produced globally, food is not produced where it is most needed.  recent estimates by fao and the organization for economic cooperation and development indicate that globally, agricultural productivity is projected to increase faster than the 15 percent increase in the demand for agricultural products over the next decade - with decelerating greenhouse gas emissions and without substantial expansion in land use.  but instead of providing incentives to farmers to produce more nutritious food, many countries keep on subsidizing products with low nutritional value, favouring staple foods - wheat, rice, maize - over fruits and vegetables. this has negative implications for nutrition and dietary diversity. nutrient-dense foods like eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables can be very expensive, especially in poorer countries, which makes it harder for people to move away from staples. in richer countries, and a growing number of lower income countries, unhealthy foods are cheaper, readily available, and more convenient. at the same time, less time is spent preparing meals at home, and consumers, especially in urban areas, increasingly rely on supermarkets, fast food outlets, street food vendors and take-away restaurants.  people have moved from seasonal, mainly plant-based and fibre-rich dishes to energy-dense diets - high in refined starches, sugar, fats, salt, processed foods, meat and other animal-source products. unhealthy diets are one of the leading causes of death across the globe from non-communicable diseases (ncds), including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and certain cancers, taking a large toll on national health budgets. obesity is projected to cost $2 trillion annually in lost economic productivity and direct health care costs worldwide.   how to make healthy diets available and accessible for all   to address this situation, fao calls for: better incentives for the world's agricultural producers; easier-to-understand and more comprehensive food labels and responsible advertising to help consumers choose healthier diets; more sustainable trade with clear rules; and a push to think of nutrition as part of food safety. the private sectors should also re-formulate products to make them more nutritious whilst food companies that produce nutritious foods could be given incentives to make their products more accessible and affordable. ict should also be applied more widely along agriculture value chains to create new platforms, reduce urban-rural disparity and the potential of the smart phone as a new farming tool should be tapped for higher productivity. fao is working with partners and communities around the world to step up efforts to achieve sustainable development goal 2 - zero hunger and healthy diets.  this includes developing with the world health organization guiding principles on ""healthy sustainable diets"", supporting the implementation of the decade of action on nutrition (2016-2025), and providing support for global, regional and national food security and nutrition policies, strategies and programmes. note: fao celebrates world food day each year on 16 october to commemorate the founding of the organization in 1945. events are organized in some 150 countries across the world.",2021-04-16

""the implementation of clearly western technologies in food production and food processing significantly affects the food cultures of the populations of the earth. we must feed everyone, but not everyone must necessarily eat the same things,"" said archbishop vincenzo paglia, president of the pontifical academy for life. the protection of biological diversity (human, plant, animal diversity) must be the focus of our attention and must guide the whole process, from the design phases (ethics by design) to the way in which these are proposed and spread in different social and cultural contexts,"" he added. ""transforming our food systems requires innovative solutions to ensure food security and nutrition for all,"" said fao director-general qu dongyu. ""at fao, together with the development of ai tools, we work towards establishing the international platform for digital food and agriculture - an inclusive multi-stakeholder forum for identifying and discussing the potential benefits and risks of digitalization of the food and agricultural sectors. for this aspect we really appreciate and expect colleagues from the ai and digital giants to offer us assistance, cooperation and engagement to help the (fao) member countries and the farmers,"" he added.

""at microsoft, we believe technology can help unlock solutions for some of the world's biggest challenges,"" said microsoft president brad smith. ""technologies such as ai and machine learning tools will be particularly helpful as we work to address worldwide hunger and food insecurity issues, especially in a world grappling with climate change. these tools can forecast issues and respond with critical resources that help prevent future famines and save lives.""  ai in agriculture, a crucial opportunity to achieve sustainable development  artificial intelligence has an important role to play in transforming food systems and helping to address food and nutrition insecurity. in the agricultural sectors, it can do so in several ways, including optimizing or even carrying out some human activities, such as planting and harvesting, thus increasing productivity, improving working conditions - by reducing the amount of time and toil - and using natural resources more efficiently, including through better knowledge management and planning.  in particular, as e-agriculture technology advances rapidly, ai in farming is emerging in three major areas: agricultural robotics, soil and crop monitoring, and predictive analytics. progress in these areas can, in the context of climate change, population growth and depleting natural resources, contribute greatly to soil and water conservation which are increasingly key to achieving food security in a sustainable way.  at today's event, two examples of best practices in the use of ai in agriculture were presented:   fao's wapor portal which monitors and reports on agriculture water productivity over africa and the near east. it provides open access to the water productivity database and its thousands of underlying map layers, and also allows for direct data queries, time series analyses, area statistics and data download of key variables associated to water and land productivity assessments;  the agricultural stress index system (asis) is a quick-look indicator developed by fao for the early monitoring of agricultural areas with a high likelihood of water stress/drought at global, regional and country level, using satellite technology. drought affects more people than any other type of natural disaster and is the most damaging to livelihoods, especially in developing countries.putting people, including farmers, at the centre the rome call for ai ethics stresses that ""ai systems must be conceived, designed and implemented to serve and protect human beings and the environment in which they live,"" a concept that many participants at today's event reiterated. underpinning the rome call are several key principles including: transparency, in that ai systems must be explainable; inclusion, so that the needs of all human beings are taken into account and they are offered the best possible conditions to express themselves and develop; and impartiality, so that such technologies do not create or act according to bias, to the advantage of just a few.  in relation to these principles, and in the context of the use of ai in agriculture, the partners and co-signatories to the rome call recognize the need to protect the rights of farmers and the knowledge that they possess, particularly those in developing countries. there is also a need to bridge the digital divide - 6 billion people are without broadband today, 4 billion without internet, 2 billion without mobile phones and 400 million people are without a digital signal and there are also significant gaps in access to resources between men and women, young and old. the partners to the rome call have urged countries and the public sector, to take advantage of the opportunities presented by ai to support small-scale farmers and enhance rural development, poverty eradication and improvement of food security. to do so they should invest in human capital and put in place policies and regulations that minimize the risk of exclusion and inequality.",2021-04-16

"133","Artificial fish habitats along Somali coast to benefit coastal communities","","7 december, 2015, bosasso, somalia - fao, working with the european union, has just completed the deployment of 25 ""fish magnets"" along somalia's 3,300-km coastline, a move that will boost the nation's small-scale artisanal fisheries.  the fish-aggregating devices (fads) consist of a floating buoy and ""habitat mat"" a few metres across. plant life quickly grows under the mat, attracting large numbers of fish -- in essence creating new high-density fishing grounds where none existed before. the 25 ""fish magnets"" will attract many different fish species, including tuna, that normally small-scale fishers cannot easily catch, making fishing more safe and efficient, while also encouraging fishers to switch their fishing efforts away from habitats such as coral reefs and sea grasses that are vulnerable to overfishing. the effort has been funded by the governments of japan and switzerland, while the european union naval forces (eunavfor) - which has a regional role in combatting piracy and monitoring fisheries  - has provided critical protection and logistical support for the vessel that deployed the fads.  ""the fads initiative is at the heart of the work by fao and our partners to boost coastal livelihoods, strengthen resilience and tackle the underlying causes of piracy - illegal fishing, degradation of local fisheries, high levels of youth unemployment, and food insecurity,"" said richard trenchard, fao representative in somalia. the european union head of delegation and ambassador to somalia, michele cervone d'urso, commended the fad programme as a crucial addition to efforts aimed at creating employment in somalia's piracy-affected areas.   ""this is an integrated approach to creating long-term, sustainable employment opportunities to youth and women as alternatives to piracy and migration, by developing the value chains of the fishery and livestock sector within the coastal communities of puntland, galmudug and banadir where traditionally communities have combined seasonal fishing and pastoral activities,"" said d'urso.  fao worked with 20 communities as well as federal and regional ministries in somalia to identify the deployment locations and ensure that the fads would be accepted and well used. broad-based development just over one million people in somalia currently face severe food insecurity, while an estimated 307,800 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, according to fao data. the un agency sees sustainable fisheries as a key element of tackling food insecurity and malnutrition in the country. according to fao's trenchard, the devices should help kick-start further longer-term development support to these communities, most importantly, investment to strengthen market linkages. ""as well as expanding the fads programme to other areas, we will be working with the ministries and the fishing communities to attract further investment for ice machines, cold storage and processing facilities, improved landing sites and, of course, better roads to bring fresh fish to markets as quickly as possible,"" trenchard said. related fao activities in somalia include boat building, fish preservation training, distribution of solar fridges, construction of jetties and the registration of fishers, much of which has been supported by generous funding from norway and the united kingdom. additionally, with european union funding, fao plans to launch a broader programme to stimulate further growth across the fisheries sector and further reduce the chances of piracy re-emerging in the future.  sustainability is key while fads can have negative environmental impacts when used unwisely, fao has been at the forefront of developing guidelines for their sustainable use, building on lessons learned elsewhere. position is key in ensuring the sustainability of fads. in somalia, the fao devices have been deployed in carefully targeted deepwater locations and are anchored to the seabed.  and fao has been actively engaging with women, youth and fishers as well as relevant authorities to develop local management best practices and agreed rules that will reduce the chance of local conflict and ensure sustainable use of each fad. these rules are enshrined in local agreements, signed by village elders, co-op leaders as well as government ministries.",2021-04-16
"134","Agriculture bears major brunt of disaster impacts, new report says","http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4434e.pdf","17 march 2015, sendai, japan - nearly a quarter of damages wrought by natural disasters on the developing world are borne by the agricultural sector according to initial results from a new fao study released here today at the un world conference for disaster risk reduction. the organization also announced the launch of a special facility aimed at helping countries better equip their food production sectors to reduce risk exposure, limit impacts, and be better prepared to cope with disasters. twenty-two percent of all damages inflicted by natural hazards such as drought, floods storms or tsunamis are registered within the agriculture sector, fao's analysis of 78 post-disaster needs assessments in 48 developing countries spanning the 2003-2013 period shows. these damages and losses are often incurred by poor rural and semi-rural communities without insurance and lacking the financial resources needed to regain lost livelihoods. yet only 4.5 percent of post-disaster humanitarian aid in the 2003-2013 period targeted agriculture. fao's 22 percent figure represents only damages reported via post-disaster risk assessments, so while indicative of scale, the actual impact is likely even higher. to arrive at a closer estimate of the true financial cost of disasters to developing world agriculture fao compared decreases in yields during and after disasters with yield trends in 67 countries affected by (at least one) medium- to larger-scale events between 2003 and 2013. the final tally: $70 billion in damages to crops and livestock over that 10 year period. asia was the most affected region, with estimated losses adding up to $28 billion, followed by africa at $26 billion. ""agriculture and all that it encompasses is not only critical for our food supply, it also remains a main source of livelihoods across the planet. while it is a sector at risk, agriculture also can be the foundation upon which we build societies that are more resilient and better equipped to deal with disasters,"" said fao director-general josé graziano da silva. ""this is why building resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises is one of fao's top priorities,"" he added.new facility for disaster risk reduction in agricultureto help countries better prepare for and respond to disasters affecting agriculture, fao today launched a new facility aimed at channeling technical support to where it is most needed. the facility will work to mainstream disaster risk reduction in agriculture at all levels through diverse activities. ""with this new effort, we are aiming to limit peoples' exposure to risks, avoid or reduce impacts where possible, and enhance preparedness to respond quickly when disasters occur,"" said graziano da silva. studies have shown that for every one dollar spent on disaster risk reduction, as much as four dollars are returned in terms of avoided or diminished impacts, he noted. the work of the new facility will be guided by fao's framework programme on disaster risk reduction for food and nutrition security.agriculture remains a key sectorworldwide, the livelihoods of 2.5 billion people depend on agriculture. these small-scale farmers, herders, fishers and forest-dependent communities generate more than half of global agricultural production and are particularly at risk from disasters that destroy or damage harvests, equipment, supplies, livestock, seeds, crops and stored food. beyond the obvious consequences on peoples' food security, the economies and development trajectories of entire regions and nations can be altered when disasters hit agriculture. the sector accounts for as much as 30 percent of national gdp in countries like burkina faso, burundi, central african republic, chad, ethiopia, kenya, mali, mozambique, the niger, among others. there are also spill-over losses in agriculture-dependent subsectors, and significant consequences for trade flows. countries surveyed experienced an increase in agriculture imports to the tune of $18.9 billion and a decrease in agriculture exports of $14.9 billion following natural disasters, between 2003 and 2013.key factsfrom fao's analysis of damages reported via needs assessmentsbased only on damages reported in 78 post-disaster risk assessments in 48 countries covering the 2003-2013 period, losses of $140 billion were registered by all economic sectors - $30 billion of these were to agriculture (crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries).when droughts occur, agriculture absorbs up to 84 percent of all economic impacts.within the agricultural sector, 42 percent of assessed losses were to crops ($13 billion) - with floods the main culprit responsible for 60 percent of crop damages followed by storms (23 percent of crop damages).livestock is the second most affected subsector after crops, accounting for 36 percent of all damage and losses, for a total of $11 billion during the 2003-2013 period.out of the 78 disasters assessed, 45 involved impacts to the fisheries subsector ($1.7 billion, or 6 percent all damages born by the agricultural sector). the lion's share - 70 percent - was caused by tsunamis, typically infrequent events. storms such as hurricanes and typhoons account for roughly 16 percent of the economic impact on fisheries, followed by floods (10 percent).the forestry sector incurred $737 million in damages and losses, representing 2.4 percent of the total for the agricultural sector.from fao's expanded analysisfao also compared decreases in yields during and after disasters with typical yield trends in 67 different countries affected by at least one medium- to larger-scale event between 2003 and 2013, in an expanded analysis, in order to arrive at a closer estimate of financial costs.based on this expanded analysis, losses and damages to crops and livestock over that period are estimated to total $70 billion. data gaps mean the total is likely higher still.82% of production losses were caused by drought (44 percent) and floods (39 percent).asia was the most affected region, with estimated losses adding up to $28 billion, followed by africa at $26 billion.in africa, between 2003 and 2013 there were 61 drought years in sub-saharan africa affecting 27 countries and 150 million people. fao estimates that 77 percent of all agricultural production losses suffered worldwide due to drought occurred in those 27 sub-saharan countries, with losses adding up to $23.5 billion.",2021-04-16

""we must now turn our words into actions and perform specific activities to conserve bees and other pollinators, thus taking care of their survival and, consequently, our own survival,"" slovenia's minister of agriculture, forestry and food dejan idan said.more than 75 percent of the world's food crops rely to some extent on pollination for yield and quality. the absence of bees and other pollinators would wipe out coffee, apples, almonds, tomatoes and cocoa, to name just a few of the crops that rely on pollination.   ""each one of us has an individual responsibility towards protecting bees and we should all make pollinator-friendly choices. even growing flowers at home to feed bees contributes to this effort,"" graziano da silva said.  pollinators, such as bees, wild bees, birds, bats, butterflies and beetles fly, hop and crawl over flowers to help plants fertilize. pollinator numbers and diversity have declined in the past decades, and evidence indicates that the decline is primarily a consequence of human activities including climate change which can disrupt flowering seasons. sustainable agriculture practices, and in particular agroecology, can help protect bees by reducing exposure to pesticides and helping to diversify the agricultural landscape.  ""through agroecology, fao seeks to optimize the interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment. innovations are needed and they must be based on the co-creation of knowledge, combining science with local knowledge and experiences, as a social process,"" graziano da silva said. with the world health organization, fao has also developed the international code of conduct on pesticide management. this provides a framework on best practices that can help decrease the exposure of pollinators to pesticide.  the official ceremony for the first world bee day will be held tomorrow in the slovenian village of breznica, 50 kilometres north-west of the capital, under the patronage of slovenia's president borut pahor. breznica is the birth place in 1734 of anton jana, an apiarist and a pioneer of modern apiculture. his birthday, may 20, was chosen to be marked annually as world bee day.  slovenia, with fao, was instrumental in establishing the international day through a un general assembly resolution adopted unanimously last year, with support from apimondia, or the international federation of beekeepers' associations as well as slovenia's beekeepers' association and the ministry of agriculture, forestry and food.",2021-04-16
"136","2050: A third more mouths to feed","","23 september 2009, rome - producing 70 percent more food for an additional 2.3 billion people by 2050 while at the same time combating poverty and hunger, using scarce natural resources more efficiently and adapting to climate change are the main challenges world agriculture will face in the coming decades, according to an fao discussion paper published today.the un agency will organize a high-level expert forum in rome on 12-13 october 2009 to discuss strategies on ""how to feed the world in 2050"". the forum will bring together around 300 leading experts from academic, nongovernmental and private sector institutions from developing and developed countries. the forum will prepare the ground for the world summit on food security, to take place in rome 16-18 november 2009. cautious optimism""fao is cautiously optimistic about the world's potential to feed itself by 2050,"" said fao assistant director-general hafez ghanem. however, he pointed out that feeding everyone in the world by then will not be automatic and several significant challenges have to be met.ghanem said there was a need for a proper socioeconomic framework to address imbalances and inequalities and ensure that everyone in the world has access to the food they need and that food production is carried out in a way that reduces poverty and take account of natural resource constraints. global projections show that in addition to projected investments in agriculture, further significant investment will be needed to enhance access to food, otherwise some 370 million people could still be hungry in 2050, almost 5 percent of the developing countries' population. according to the latest un projections, world population will rise from 6.8 billion today to 9.1 billion in 2050 - a third more mouths to feed than there are today. nearly all of the population growth will occur in developing countries. sub-saharan africa's population is expected to grow the fastest (up 108 percent, 910 million people), and east and south east asia's the slowest (up 11 percent, 228 million).around 70 percent of the world population will live in cities or urban areas by 2050, up from 49 percent today. food demand the demand for food is expected to continue to grow as a result both of population growth and rising incomes. demand for cereals (for food and animal feed) is projected to reach some 3 billion tonnes by 2050. annual cereal production will have to grow by almost a billion tonnes (2.1 billion tonnes today), and meat production by over 200 million tonnes to reach a total of 470 million tonnes in 2050, 72 percent of which will be consumed in developing countries, up from the 58 percent today. the production of biofuels could also increase the demand for agricultural commodities, depending on energy prices and government policies. land despite the fact that 90 percent of the growth in crop production is projected to come from higher yields and increased cropping intensity, arable land will have to expand by around 120 million hectares in developing countries, mainly in sub-saharan africa and latin america. arable land in use in developed countries is expected to decline by some 50 million hectares, although this could be changed by the demand for biofuels.globally, there are still sufficient land resources available to feed the future world population. fao cautioned, however, that much of the potential land is suitable for growing only a few crops, not necessarily the crops with highest demand and it is concentrated in a few countries. much of the land not yet in use also suffers from chemical and physical constraints, endemic diseases and lack of infrastructure which cannot be easily overcome.  therefore significant investments would need to be undertaken in order to bring it into production. part of the land is also covered by forests, or subject to expanding urban settlements. a number of countries, particularly in the near east/north africa and south asia have already reached or are about to reach the limits of land available.    water water withdrawals for irrigated agriculture are projected to grow at a slower pace due to reduced demand and improved water use efficiency, but will still increase by almost 11 percent by 2050. globally, fresh water resources are sufficient, but they are very unevenly distributed and water scarcity will reach alarming levels in an increasing number of countries or regions within countries, particularly in the near east/north africa and south asia. using less water and at the same time producing more food will be the key to addressing water scarcity problems. water scarcity could be made more acute by changing rainfall patters resulting from climate change.yield potential all in all, the potential to raise crop yields to feed a growing world population seems to be considerable, fao said. ""if the appropriate socio-economic incentives are in place, there are still ample bridgeable' gaps in yield (i.e. differences between agro-ecologically attainable and actual yields) that could be exploited. fears that yields are reaching a plateau do not seem warranted, except in a very few special instances.""stronger interventionsfao called for stronger interventions to make faster progress towards reducing and finally eliminating the number of hungry and poor people. investment in primary agriculture should become a top priority and needs to increase by some 60 percent since agriculture not only produces food but also generates income and supports rural livelihoods. poverty reduction also requires investments in rural infrastructure (roads, ports, power, storage and irrigation systems); investments in institutions, research and extension services, land titles and rights, risk management, veterinary and food safety control systems; and non-agricultural investment including food safety nets and cash transfers to the most needy.without developing and investing in rural areas in poor countries, deprivation and inequalities will remain widespread, though significantly less than today, fao said.",2021-04-16

""just like the covid-19 pandemic, amr is no longer a future threat. it is happening here and now, and is affecting us all"", said deputy director-general maria helena semedo. ""around the world people, animals and plants are already dying of infections that cannot be treated - even with our strongest antimicrobial treatments. if amr is left unchecked, the next pandemic we face could be bacterial and much deadlier if the drugs needed to treat it do not work"".   fao's work on amr is implemented in coordination with who and oie using a ""one health"" approach.  amr in food and agriculture food and agriculture sectors have a pivotal role to play in tackling amr. in many parts of the world, antimicrobial use is far greater in animals than in humans, and it is rapidly increasing as our populations grow and global demand for food increases.  amr is spreading quicker than scientists can develop new antimicrobials and is threatening global food systems, food security, food safety, health systems and economies. our only solution is to take strategic action to keep the antimicrobials we have working. it is not too late, but time is running out to stop this devastation from worsening, fao warned today.  on 23 november, the un agency will launch a new community of behaviour change practitioners to design solutions that make it easier for people to use antimicrobials appropriately and prevent disease effectively. combining a wealth of insights from farmers and other food chain actors, veterinarians, epidemiologists, amr experts and behavioural scientists, this community of practice will work together to nudge' behaviours at both farm and policy level - to help slow down the spread of amr. about waaw activities and initiatives for world antimicrobial awareness week will be taking place around the world, including a waaw africa twitter chat on how can we improve awareness for antimicrobial resistance in africa?' on 21 november, a brussels infopoint event for policy makers and the public to raise awareness on the urgency of tackling amr on 24 november, and the philippines will host an amr one health summit and webinar series throughout the week. become an ally in the fight against amr! fao outlined today actions for each group of key players that are critical in the fight against amr: farmers:   1.    thoroughly wash your hands, shoes and clothing before and after contact with animals. this helps eliminate germs that make animals and people sick.   2.    keep animals healthy. healthy animals need fewer antimicrobials, which means lower treatment costs, improved food and livelihood security and fewer animal deaths. when it comes to agriculture, farmers can take these steps to keep animals healthy:    keep animal housing and outside areas that animals use clean.  reduce the risk of spreading germs. implement appropriate biosecurity measures.  practice ""all-in and all-out"" on your farm to reduce the risk of new animals infecting the animals you already have.  keep animal feed dry and stored safely away from rodents, birds, insects and other animals that can carry bacteria or other germs.  avoid stress for your animals.  help your animals stay healthy and avoid illness by ensuring they have good nutrition and clean water.  vaccinate! ask your veterinary expert to help you administer important vaccines at the right times.  3.    seek animal health professional advice for the correct diagnosis and treatment, because using the wrong drug puts your animals, your family and you at risk of antimicrobial resistant infections.  4.    spread the word, not the microbes! tell other farmers and community members what you have learned about why it is important to use antimicrobials responsibly.   5.    only use pesticides as a last resort: pesticides are not the only solution. only use pesticides on your plants as a last resort for controlling diseases. food chain workers and consumers:  1.     follow the four cs' of food safety to help reduce the spread of superbugs and microorganisms that could make people ill.  cleaning - wash your hands thoroughly before and after contact with food and livestock (especially after touching raw meat) and after using the toilet. regularly clean surfaces that are used to prepare food.  cooking - cook food well to kill dangerous germs. do not reheat food multiple times.  chilling - keep food chilled at the right temperature in the fridge and when being transported.  cross contamination - keep food preparation and storage areas clean to avoid cross contamination. store and process raw meats separately from other foods.  2.     start conversations! discuss amr with your colleagues, family, friends and community. encourage your workplace to develop and adopt measures that help reduce the spread of amr.  3.     help keep antimicrobials working for everyone! follow your doctor's advice on whether you or your family need antibiotics. always seek expert medical advice before taking antibiotics.policymakers:  1.      make amr a priority.  commit resources to tackling amr and meeting national amr action plan targets now. ensure amr is firmly on the political agenda.  2.      involve stakeholders in policy decisions: involving stakeholders from all stages of the food chain and across public and private sectors will help develop more effective policies and legislation. resource partners:  1.     support the tripartite's work on amr: the amr multi-partner trust fund, led by fao, world organisation for animal health (oie) and world health organization (who), aims to scale up efforts to support countries in tackling amr with a one health approach. support the tripartite to expand this work to more countries and lead the fight against amr.  2.    fill knowledge gaps: support research and projects on amr where evidence is lacking.health, agriculture, environment and veterinary educators and researchers:   1.    champion amr as a key issue within your institutions: make amr a mandatory part of the curriculum. lead cross-sectoral events and activities, including lectures, webinars and seminars to increase understanding of the spread of amr across sectors.  2.    share knowledge across borders: invite researchers from around the world to speak at your institutions and share ideas. young people and student groups:  1.      raise your voice! champion amr as a priority for your student groups and associations and lead awareness raising activities such as walks, talks and events within your communities. 2.    share examples of your activities: share examples of your advocacy work on social media and with journalists. inspire other groups to take action and become amr champions'.private sector stakeholders:  1.      support amr action in the workplace: provide facilities in your workplaces, factories and sites that make it easier for employees to take action against amr.  2.      be a responsible manufacturer: ensure that you and your suppliers are disposing of waste and wastewater correctly to help reduce the spread of superbugs. ngos and civil society groups: 1.         incorporate amr actions into existing and new projects: many actions to reduce the spread of superbugs have benefits for health, sanitation, disease control and waste management. these actions can be inexpensive to implement. incorporate these into existing initiatives.  2.       create dialogue: discuss amr and superbugs with the communities in which you work, and raise awareness of the need to keep antimicrobials working.  animal health professionals 1.         start conversations on good practices when treating animals with antimicrobial drugs: when visiting farms and dispensing medicines, discuss amr and animal health with farmers to open a dialogue on the issue. 2.        be part of the amr movement!  create, join and talk at animal health clubs, groups and meetings in your area. share examples of your work in amr to encourage others to become amr champions.",2021-04-16

""the locust fighting machine that has been assembled in east africa is now fully equipped and able to contain, suppress and we believe, eventually end this record-breaking upsurge,"" said fao deputy director-general laurent thomas. ""governments have built up capacity in record-time. swarms have been massively reduced in number and in size. it would be tragic to throw these achievements away just as the nations of east africa are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" thomas said, adding: ""there is a real possibility they could bring this upsurge to an end this year, but they need to be able to continue doing what they are doing, without faltering.""  some $38.8 million in additional funding will be needed to allow that to happen through june, fao informed humanitarian partners at today's briefing, urging them to help east africa and yemen get through the last mile of their desert locust marathon. a quantum leap in readiness when the first wave of locusts first exploded across east africa in early january 2020, fuelled by heavy rains dumped by an abnormally late season cyclone, many countries had little or no capacity to monitor movements of the pest or mount control activities at scale. indeed, most had not seen a locust incursion of such magnitude in over 50 years. now, one year on, with fao support they have succeeded in fielding a locust fighting force in the air and on the ground that involves 28 airplanes and helicopters, 260 ground units, and some 3,000 newly trained spotters and control operators. over 6,000 hours of air sorties have been flown to spot and spray infestations of the pest. new innovations such as the elocust3 digital tools, satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, and trajectory models have been harnessed to report locusts in real-time and deliver maps of infestations, breeding areas, and migration routes. more than 1.5 million hectares of land have been treated in east africa and yemen since the start of the campaign in january 2020. fao estimates these efforts helped avoid crop and dairy losses worth an estimated at $1.2 billion, safeguarding the livelihoods of 28 million people.2021 is not 2020 all over again while the locusts remain a threat, east africa is starting off 2021 on a much better footing. the upsurge that started last january has been sustained by consistently favourable weather conditions ever since, causing a cascade of reproduction that saw an unusually large population of the pest disperse and persist across the region, notwithstanding the successful large-scale control operations that were scaled up to meet the threat.  and in recent months, heavy rains and another late-season cyclone sparked a new round of breeding, causing more swarms to form. as a result, kenya and southern ethiopia are currently being re-invaded, after having beat back the first incursion last year. even the united republic of tanzania recently witnessed a swarm in the northeast. but despite this renewed activity, the situation today is not at all the same as it was 12 months ago, thanks to generous donor support, according to fao. for one, the countries of the region are now prepared, equipped, and ready. secondly, the numbers of desert locusts are much reduced, with fewer swarms of decreased density and size. for instance, one mega-swarm detected last year in kenya covered 240 000 hectares of land, an area the size of luxembourg. today, however, control teams are treating smaller swarms of 100-1 000 hectares or so at a time. ""the last time africa saw an upsurge of locusts approaching this scale, in the sahel, it took two years and more than $500 million to bring under control. this upsurge was even bigger, but east africa is poised to end it -- provided governments can keep those aircraft flying,"" said fao's thomas.",2021-04-16

""agri-food systems are the world's largest economic system, measured in terms of employment, livelihoods and planetary impact,"" qu said, noting that four billion people are employed directly or indirectly in food systems, in which poverty and hunger are nonetheless endemic. ""transforming our food systems is among the most powerful ways to change course and make progress towards all 17 sdgs and build back better' from covid-19,"" qu told the audience.after his presentation, qu also participated in a round-table on science diplomacy with joachim von braun, president of the pontifical academy of sciences, director of germany's center for development research (zef) and chair of the scientific group for the 2021 food systems summit, and lincei president giorgio parisi, a theoretical physicist who has done pioneering work in statistics and complexity, ""disordered systems"" and the dynamics of rome's whirling storms of starlings. the director-general's presentation called for more ""system thinking"", in a broad spectrum of areas including policies, business models and even culture. focusing on the need to move from strategy to action, he outlined how today's agri-food systems are ""not delivering"", noting that as many as 690 million people are chronically undernourished, with the covid-19 pandemic projected to add more than 100 million; one in five children are stunted; three billion people cannot afford healthy diets; and one in 10 people are affected by unsafe food supplies. he also pointed to the scale of global food loss and waste and the fact that 80 percent of the world's extreme poor live in rural areas and work in agriculture. dramatic improvements are needed in these areas, including reducing both undernourishment and obesity to below five percent of the population in all countries, substantially reducing inequalities, and progress towards a host of environment and climate related targets. director-general qu's lectio magistralis was part of a series of high-profile speeches at the lincei, a scientific institute dating back to the early 17th century that once counted galileo as a member. among those invited to the series, which focuses on global challenges needing multilateral solutions, are monsignor paul richard gallagher, the vatican's secretary for relations with states; european central bank president christine lagarde; and international atomic energy agency director-general rafael mariano grossi.  the four bettersdirector-general qu elaborated a strategic approach framed by what he calls the ""four betters"". better production requires ensuring efficient sustainable consumption and production patterns, inclusive food and agriculture supply chains at local, regional and global levels. digital agriculture, attention to small-scale producers and green innovation are all key parts of the path forward.better nutrition means ending hunger, promoting nutritious foods and increasing access to healthy diets, which can be buoyed by tackling food loss and waste and making sure that markets and trade are accessible and open.better environment involves protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, promoting a good environment for farming systems, and combating climate change through reduction, reutilization, recycling and residual management approaches. conserving biodiversity, including agrobiodiversity and dietary diversity, is a critical spur to action on this front.better life can be achieved by reducing inequalities - between urban and rural areas, rich and poor, and men and women - and promoting inclusive economic growth. the director-general added that fao's signature hand-in-hand initiative is aimed at boosting rural transformation, urban food systems and resilient agri-food systems by scaling up appropriate investments. currently 34 countries have joined the programme, which is based on matchmaking between suitable partners and an overarching targeting of the world's poorest. the lecture today, attended by senior figures from italy's government and academic institutions, was carried live by italy's state television broadcaster rai.",2021-04-16

""i am committed to strengthening fao's engagement with the private sector and all partners in a fully transparent manner. an efficient, transparent and inclusive fao is my highest priority,"" he said.  with the new strategy, fao aims to engage with the private sector to support and scale up innovation, promote investments, mobilize scientific expertise, generate data for sdg monitoring - among other aspects - based on shared resources, networks, knowledge and technologies. the strategy defines as potential partners financial institutions; large national and multinational companies; micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes); farmers and farmers' organizations; industry and trade associations; philanthropic foundations; as well as producer-organizations and cooperatives. covid-19 response and food coalition the director-general stressed that from the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, fao has used its technical expertise and international standing to raise awareness, disseminate knowledge and rally concrete action, including joint statements with other organizations (who, wto, world bank, wfp and ifad) and a dedicated website with more than 70 analysis and policy brief documents on the various aspects of the pandemic's impact, as well as a mapping tool displaying information on planting and harvesting months for key food and agriculture commodities.  he alluded to the launch of fao's comprehensive covid-19 response and recovery programme for immediate and medium to longer-term actions to prevent the health crisis becoming a food crisis.  the programme aims to support countries to ""build back better"" by strengthening the longer-term resilience of food systems and livelihoods, addressing the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic and reflecting the three pillars of sustainable development. up to now the programme has mobilized more than $193 million through voluntary contributions and technical cooperation programs.  the director-general also referred to the launch of the food coalition, an initiative proposed by the government of italy and led by fao with the participation of key and strategic partners. the food coalition supports the covid-19 response and recovery programmme by raising awareness, mobilizing financial resources, technical expertise, and innovation. fao will serve as a neutral leader and convener of the food coalition, using its expansive network of country offices to ensure that the views and needs of countries and national partners are fully prioritized. hand-in-hand and other new initiatives  the director-general updated members about the implementation of the hand-in-hand initiative, which is already  supporting the efforts of 30 countries to end poverty (sdg1) and hunger and all forms of malnutrition (sdg2) in a country-owned and country-led manner.  ""based on the wide interest and overwhelming positive reactions received so far, i am confident that this number will increase significantly in the coming months,"" qu said.  he also alluded to the state-of-the-art technologies that support the hand-in-hand-initiative, such as the geospatial data platform which delivers key information for decision-making and earth map, which fao recently launched with google.  ""we are walking the talk when it comes to integrating innovative approaches and digital technologies in our core business,"" he said, stressing that the international platform for digital food and agriculture is another important element in this approach. the proposed terms of reference of the platform have already been developed, as requested by the last session of the council, and are under review by fao's technical committees.  on 3 december, a high-level dialogue on the international platform for digital food and agriculture will discuss the potential and the challenges of the new platform. the director-general also alluded to the fao green cities initiative and its action program recently launched on the margins of the 75th session of the un general assembly. ""the aim of the initiative is to improve people's wellbeing through increased availability of and access to green products and services provided by green spaces, green industries, green economy and green way of lifestyle - including integration of urban and peri-urban forestry, fisheries, horticulture and agriculture - and through sustainable agri-food systems,"" qu said. furthermore, qu talked about plans to launch the 1 000 digital villages initiative, which aims to enable farmers to use digital technologies, information and communication tools including social media, to promote local sustainable development. ""digital technologies can raise economic benefits and contribute to food security by increasing productivity of agricultural sectors, enhancing market opportunities through e-commerce and access to market information, facilitating inclusion of famers in value chains,"" he said. through the 1 000 digital villages initiative, a tailor-made menu for assistance in the area of digital innovation can be made according to the requests and situations of the sites. this effort will be implemented in collaboration with microsoft, ibm, the bill and melinda gates foundation and other partners.  ""our regional office for asia and the pacific is now starting a process of proposing the first round of pilot villages,"" qu said. resilience and emergency preparedness  the director-general also updated members on fao's work to support resilience and emergency preparedness, particularly in relation to desert locust and fall armyworm response.  for desert locust, fao has been able to raise over $ 203 million to tackle the pest. in the greater horn of africa and yemen, almost 1.3 million hectares have been treated since january 2020. it is estimated that over 2.5 million tons of cereal have been protected, valued at $ 765 million.  ""this is enough to feed more than 17 million people for one year and protect more than 1.2 million pastoral households from livelihood loss and distress in ethiopia alone,"" qu said. regarding the global action for fall armyworm control, eight demonstration countries and 53 pilot countries have been identified for a radical intervention at national and farmer level through a new business model that reaches over 50 percent of maize acreage in the three target regions africa, asia and the near east.  the director-general mentioned the introduction of an innovative talking smartphone app known as nuru, available in 29 languages, that channels valuable real-time and field-level information and supports smallholder farmers with specific tips on how to manage infestations. digital fao  ""today, we are proud to say that fao's virtual and digital workplace is a reality,"" said the director-general, referring to fao's transformation into a digital organization. such transformation included the improvement and revamp of the entire fao website's functionality, content and look, to serve as platform to support and include members, other un organizations, partners, and farmers, particularly smallholders. qu also cited the creation of the digital tiger team, to rapidly enable teleworking, with a scale up from it security, and the automation of collaboration and communication tools for trainings to provide the maximum and most efficient help to all fao employees worldwide ""we are continuing to spearhead the holistic concept of a digital organization within the un family, being well ahead of the curve,"" he said. the director-general also stressed that new digital fao has also been delivering digital public goods for its members!

""our gains have been significant; but the battle is long and is not yet over,"" qu said. ""more people are at risk of losing their livelihoods and worsening food security in the coming months."" while swathes of treated land are now relatively free from the voracious pest, the first wave of swarms has reproduced and a second wave of locusts will transition from juveniles to the young adult stage in june, taking flight at a critical time when many farmers in east africa prepare to harvest their crops. the desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world and a single swarm covering one square kilometre can contain up to 80 million locusts. fao's desert locust appeal, launched in january, now covers ten countries - djibouti, eritrea, ethiopia, kenya, somalia, south sudan, sudan, uganda, tanzania and yemen.  the current upsurge is particularly alarming in the broader eastern africa region, with recently released forecasts from the global report on food crises indicating that over 25 million people will face acute food insecurity in the region in the second half of 2020. in yemen, where locusts have been reproducing in hard-to-access inland areas, an additional 17 million people are acutely food insecure. but those estimates were made before the impact of covid-19 in a region of acute food insecurity. ""we can and must protect vulnerable people from the impact of multiple crises: conflicts, climate extremes, desert locusts and covid-19, which threaten to cause a further dramatic deterioration in their food security,"" qu said. ""to do this, we need to intensify our efforts further and focus not just on controls but on supporting the livelihoods of farmers and pastoralists so they can get through this."" since fao launched its desert locust response in january, its appeal has been $130 million funded, the report said. however, funding has concentrated on locust control activities and much more backing for livelihoods support activities is needed. qu thanked political leaders in the affected countries for their efforts in mobilizing staff and resources and working closely with fao to design, monitor and implement control operations.  while locust control and surveillance operations are led by national governments, fao is providing critical support in the form of pesticides, bio-pesticides, equipment, aircraft and training. so far this year, more 365,000 hectares have been controlled in the ten countries covered by the fao appeal. while governments keep expanding their efforts to control the current upsurge with fao's support, conditions remain very favourable for locust reproduction and will require sustained and geographically expanded efforts. the revised version of the appeal to be launched in the coming weeks is expected to also seek resources for the islamic republic of iran and pakistan, which are also dealing with locust infestations and for scaling up preparedness efforts in the sahel region which might also be affected. desert locust monitoring, forecasting and control are at the heart of fao's mandate. its desert locust information service has been in operation for nearly 50 years. fao's well-established field presence, ability to link up authorities from different countries, and expertise in desert locust management and forecasting, make it a key player in responding to upsurges like that currently affecting east africa and the red sea area.",2021-04-16

""our nuclear science has a lot to contribute to the four betters that guide fao's strategy to eradicating hunger and boosting rural development,"" says liang qu, director of the joint centre. fao director-general qu dongyu's four betters - better production, better nutrition, better environment and a better life - signal cross-cutting approaches to making the world's agri-food systems fit for purpose in delivering health, food safety and livelihood benefits for all. from releasing sterile tsetse flies to sorting the sex of mosquito larvae the work the joint centre conducts across the world and in its state-of-the-art laboratories near vienna spans the spectrum from food irradiation to ensuring developing countries' agricultural output meets international phytosanitary standards for trade, to using mutagenesis to enable essential crops to ward off pests and diseases; from releasing sterile insects to suppress and even eradicate some major insect pests, to detecting the presence of harmful chemicals in food. and the list goes on. the sterile insect technique (sit) is a major area in which the joint centre has been the global pioneer. it consists of releasing sterile insects to suppress population growth of pests such as the tsetse fly, which drastically reduces cattle welfare and productivity across africa; or the fruit fly, which is a menace to global trade in fruits and vegetables and therefore a major factor for destroying the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. tropical fruit farmers in thailand have benefited from an eight-fold increase in exports of premium mango, guava, mangosteen and durian, thanks to the technique introduced by the joint centre. in the area of pest control alone, the centre currently has 32 active technical cooperation projects underway in the field, as well as a host of research initiatives. meanwhile, it is broadening the sterile insect technique to grapple with mosquitoes that serve as vectors for human diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. recently it unveiled a process driven by artificial intelligence to sort the sex of larvae as early as possible - which matters given their short lifespans.set up in 1964, the centre initially had a small number of agro-nuclear scientists. today, with an annual operating budget above fifteen millions euros, it has more than 100 scientists and technicians from different countries. their specialties range from agronomy to nuclear science, from agricultural production to health, from food safety to soil and water management, from insect pest control to nuclear emergency response.pandemics and climate change - stepping up to the challengesin february 2021, fao director-general qu dongyu and iaea director-general rafael mariano grossi agreed to step up their partnership, signing a document which upgrades what was a division into a centre. that, said qu, should catalyze ""even more concrete and impactful collaboration"", while serving as an example, according to grossi, of how both un organizations are ""growing and adapting to challenges"".fao's director-general, an advocate of innovation on all fronts, is driving fao to innovate and develop technologies to face priority issues. ""the centre is the only un entity with its own laboratories, so the chance for high-level science is extraordinary,"" noted the fao director-general, a plant biologist himself. member support for expanding the laboratory facilities has been very positive - with more than 50 million provided for the renovation of the nuclear applications laboratories (renual) project, used to build two new state-of-art laboratory buildings completed in 2019 for fao/iaea agricultural and biotechnology laboratories. agreement to mobilize an additional 26 million has been reached - allowing for further expansion of specialized modern greenhouses and a plant breeding laboratory to develop new crop varieties that cope with changing climate conditions. other climate-smart agricultural solutions are also being developed. devising new techniques to measure and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions - both in quantitative and qualitative terms - is also on the agenda.with strong supports from the directors-general of both fao and iaea, liang's team has rolled out a  new zoonotic disease integrated action (zodiac) initiative to help countries prevent pandemics caused by bacteria, parasites, fungi or viruses that originate in animals and have the potential to spread to humans. the project aims to improve tracing of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases at the animal-human interface, improve understanding of how to survey relevant ecosystems around the world, and help monitor mutant variations of pathogens at the molecular and immunological level, liang explains.last year, the centre also helped 120 countries with equipment, diagnostic kits and other material to rapidly detect sars-cov-2, the virus behind the covid-19 pandemic, in animals. similar work was done in the past to deal with ebola virus disease, mers and zika outbreaks. the centre is currently analyzing stable isotopes found in feathers and stool to map the migrations of wild birds, critical clues for understanding the epidemiology and ecology of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has proven to be a threat to food security and human lives. the centre supports more than 200 national and regional technology-transfer projects, while coordinating applied research that engages more than 400 national and international institutions and experimental stations.fingerprinting wateratom-level isotopic analyses are a promising area of future work. ""given the complexity of agri-food systems today, precision is critical,"" says liang, who has directed the centre since 2005. ""take food traceability and authenticity systems, which are increasingly demanded by people to determine the origin and detect economically motivated food adulteration."" the use of stable isotopes holds high promise for food quality and safety, a cornerstone of health and trade. ""all food has water inside, and water is h20,"" explains liang, who has been working in this field for more than three decades. ""oxygen is an atom, so water has a fingerprint, and we can determine exactly where it came from.""numerous countries are already using the centre's tracing methodology and expertise to weed out misleading claims regarding honey and grass-fed beef. others, such as china, are obtaining support to find ways to boost the protein absorption rate of dairy cows - an outcome that would be scalable on a planetary level and lead to less feed waste and decreased nitrogen pollution. knowledge that powers food safety and security china has been a beneficiary of fao's and iaea's work and is now a robust contributor, having graduated to use space-induced mutagenesis - cosmic rays are stronger in space -  to develop hundreds of new crop varieties, including luyuan 502, a drought and disease-resistant wheat strain that typically yields 11 per cent more than traditional kinds and is now planted on more than 3.6 million hectares, an area roughly the size of belgium.in bangladesh, the centre has catalyzed development and adoption of rice varieties that better fit the country's ecosystem endowment, helping the country feed its growing population and even export regionally.""mutation allows us to foster more and better-adapted characteristics for key plants and animals,"" liang says. ""biodiversity is also about intra-species richness - with genetic resources, more is better.""the fao-iaea joint centre has an ample portfolio of plant and crop breeding initiatives, including new projects that focus on major global foods such as coffee, olives, cassava and teff. the centre also develops and transfers analytical techniques for rapid and cost-effective detection of a wide range of chemical hazards such as residues resulting from controlling diseases in animals. this has greatly benefited consumer protection and promoted trade in a number of members, including benin, costa rica, pakistan, senegal, seychelles, thailand and uganda, among others.

""although more detailed data on the practice is lacking, we can say that, globally, only a small proportion of treated wastewater is being used for agriculture, most of it municipal wastewater. but increasing numbers of countries  egypt, jordan,, mexico, spain and the united states, for example  have been exploring the possibilities as they wrestle with mounting water scarcity,"" says marlos de souza, a senior officer with fao's land and water division.  ""so far, the reuse of wastewater for irrigation has been most successful near cities, where it is widely available and usually free-of-charge or at low cost, and where there is a market for agricultural produce, including non-food crops. but the practice can be used in rural areas as well  indeed it has long been employed by many smallholder farmers,"" notes de souza. the important thing is that wastewater be managed adequately and safely used in a way that is appropriate to local conditions, he adds.an alternative source of a critical resourcewater is of course fundamental for food production, and the intensifying scarcity of this important natural resource  likely to be more intense in a context of climate change  has very significant implications for humanity's ability to feed itself. globally, population growth and economic expansion are placing increasing pressure on freshwater resources, with the overall rate of groundwater withdrawals steadily increasingly by 1 percent per year since the 1980s. and those pressures are now increasingly being exacerbated by climate change.  already, agriculture accounts for 70 percent of global freshwater withdrawals  with demand for food estimated to grow by at least 50 percent by 2050, agriculture's water needs are poised to expand. yet demand from cities and by industries is on the rise as well. greater use of non-conventional, alternative sources of water  including the urban effluent and farm-runoff  can help mitigate this competition, if properly treated. in addition to helping cope with water scarcity, wastewater often has a high nutrient load, making it a good fertilizer. ""when safely used and managed to avoid health and environmental risks, wastewater can be converted from a burden to an asset,"" de souza says.managing risksuntreated wastewater often contains microbes and pathogens, chemical pollution, antibiotic residues, and other threats to the health of farmers, food chain workers, and consumers  and it also poses environmental concerns. a number of technologies and approaches exist that are being utilized around the globe to treat, manage, and use wastewater in agriculture, many of them specific to the local natural resource base, the farming systems in which they are being used, and the crops that are being produced. in egypt, for example, where water supplies are limited and wastewater tends to be highly contaminated, constructed wetlands are proving to be a promising, economically viable approach to treatment. in egypt and also in tunisia wastewater is being widely used in agroforestry projects, supporting both wood production as well as anti-desertification efforts. in central mexico, municipal wastewater has long been used to irrigate crops. in the past, ecological processes helped reduce health risks. more recently, crop restrictions  some crops can be safely grown with the wastewater, while others cannot  and the installation of water treatment facilities have been added to the system. in jordan, reclaimed water represents an impressive 25 percent of all total water use in the country. in the united states, treatment and managed aquifer recharge is a common practice, especially in the west. beyond helping tackle the problem of water scarcity, reducing environmental contamination, and supporting food production, infrastructure and management systems for reclaiming, treating, and re-using wastewater can be job creators, according to de souza. the global forum for food and agriculture, organized by the german federal ministry for food and agriculture (bmel) takes place every year, bringing together high-level decision makers, technical experts, researchers and farmers to discuss pressing issues affecting agriculture worldwide. the forum's theme this year is ""agriculture and water - key to feeding the world."" an organizing partner of the event, fao is taking the lead on a number of events at the forum.",2021-04-16

which producers submit to voluntarily -- is also designed to ensure fair returns for producers and the equitable distribution of profits along the entire value chain.""we believe that a mountain label will attract consumers that are interested in high quality and environmentally sound products and give them the information they need to make conscious choices about the values, methods and communities they want to support with their purchases,"" said rosalaura romeo, program officer of the fao's mountain partnership secretariat. the mp oversees the initiative with financial backing from the italian development cooperation.""promoting biodiversity and supporting smallholder producers are both crucial actions to improve rural development and secure the future of mountain areas,"" said general secretary of slow food paolo di croce. despite their rich culture and environmental heritage, mountain communities remain economically marginalized, he added. one reason for this is that the remoteness and isolation of mountain areas often impede producers, limiting their access to markets, extension services, credit and information. additionally, the high number of middlemen in the value chain of many mountain products means that producers do not always obtain fair compensation.by promoting high-value products that benefit biodiversity and equitable returns, the label allows consumers to buy into environmental conservation while reducing pressures that drive producers to engage in production methods harmful to the environment. as such, it simultaneously addresses poverty and unsustainable use of natural resources in highland regions and contributes to the 2030 sustainable development agenda  especially sdg1 on ending poverty in all its forms and sdg15 on the sustainable management of ecosystems and biodiversity.how it worksthe mountain label is not mandatory for mountain producers nor does it replace other labels their products may have to carry under national laws. but it's an easy tool for small scale producers and associations to set their wares apart in a positive way. those who wish to apply for the label can contact the mountain partnership secretariat directly or through local mp focal points. requests will be evaluated based on a set of criteria, including factors like the size of production, impact on the environment and the altitude at which the goods are made. the partnership will also oversee a verification system through which an appointed expert or authorized entity will periodically monitor a random sample of products carrying the mountain partnership product label to ensure the goods still meet all guidelines. for a select number of products, including those in kyrgyzstan and bolivia, fao is providing additional support. these interventions range from teaching producers new ways to scale up and add value to their existing production in the case of the kyrgyz apricots to helping start up an entirely new production and distribution chain - in the case of the revival of black amaranth in bolivia.partnershipthe initiative merges the strengths of the mountain partnership in addressing highland-specific challenges through its global network with the experience of slow food in supporting traditional crops and products which risk disappearing, protecting unique ecosystems and recovering traditional processing methods. the collaboration is part of a three-year agreement between fao and slow food to promote more inclusive food and agriculture systems at local, national and international levels. slow food joined the mountain partnership, the un alliance dedicated to improving mountain livelihoods and environments, in march 2016.",2021-04-16

""soil is the foundation of agriculture, it is where food begins,"" said fao deputy director-general maria helena semedo. ""maintaining the soil's important functions and ecosystem services to support food production and increase resilience to a changing climate calls for sustainable soil management practices.""  managing soils to protect carbon-rich soils and restore those degraded  the map shows that globally, the first 30 cm of soil contains around 680 billion tonnes of carbon - almost double the amount present in our atmosphere. this is a significant amount compared with the carbon stored in the whole vegetation (560 billion tonnes).  more than 60% of the 680 billion tonnes of carbon is found in ten countries (russia, canada, usa, china, brazil, indonesia, australia, argentine, kazakhstan and democratic republic of congo). this means that actions should be implemented towards protecting these natural carbon-rich soils to avoid emissions to the atmosphere. the degradation of one third of the world's soils has already prompted an enormous release of carbon into the atmosphere. restoring these soils can remove up to 63 billion tonnes of carbon, significantly reducing the effects of climate change.  increasing carbon content in soils to raise yields soils with high organic carbon content are likely to be more productive, better able to purify water and provide plants with optimal moisture conditions. the water stored in soil serves as the source for 90 per cent of the world's agricultural production and represents about 65 per cent of fresh water.  increasing soil organic carbon by improved management can help maintain productivity in drier conditions. therefore, actions should be taken to foster further sequestration where the conditions are suitable for that purpose. innovative good practices such as the use of deep rooting species should be promoted. ""maintaining - but especially increasing - soil carbon stocks should become an obligation as this will allow us to unlock the soil's full potential to support mitigation and adaptation actions in a changing climate,"" semedo said. participatory process this first-ever soil organic carbon map developed through an inclusive and country-driven process was supported by fao's intergovernmental technical panel on soils. ultimately, more than 100 member countries shared their national carbon maps which fao put together into a global map - it is a concrete contribution towards sustainable development goal 15 - life on earth. the next step is for countries to move into monitoring soil organic carbon levels using their national soil information systems to make evidence-based decisions on how to manage their soils and monitor the impact of those actions.  the map was possible thanks to the commitment and efforts of faos members who invested resources for preparing their national maps. fao provided intensive training sessions for national experts thanks to the financial support of the european commission, switzerland, the russian federation, the netherlands and ifa. the european commission is also thanked for technical support provided during this process.  glinka world soil prize awarded for the second time  during the 4th world soil day ceremony, the glinka world soil prize 2017 was given to asociación argentina de productores en siembra directa (aapresid) for their efforts to promote sustainable soil management practices on the ground by combating soil erosion as a direct contribution to food security in south america and the world. the glinka world soil prize, named after the pioneering russian scientist konstantin d. glinka, was established by the global soil partnership with the support of the russian federation in 2016 and honors individuals and organizations whose leadership and activities have contributed to the promotion of sustainable soil management and the protection of soil resources.   facts and figures about soil  through sustainable soil management we could produce up to 58% more food. soil preservation is essential for zero hunger world. 95% of food is produced on our soils. worldwide, nearly 80% of the average calories consumption per person comes from crops directly grown in the soil. it can take up to 1000 years to form 1cm of soil.   soils can sequester around 20 000 megatonnes of carbon in 25 years, more than 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions  soils filter sediment, pesticides, plant nutrients, salts, bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, organic chemicals from freshwater resources. there are more living individual organisms in a tablespoon of soil than there are people on earth. the majority of the known antibiotics originated from soil bacteria, including penicillin.",2021-04-16

fao today pledged to help countries develop strategies for tackling the spread of antimicrobial resistance in their food supply chains, as governments prepare to debate the emerging challenge posed by medicine-resistant ""superbugs"" next week at the un general assembly. the increased use  and abuse  of antimicrobial medicines in both human and animal healthcare has contributed to an increase in the number of disease-causing microbes that are resistant to medicines traditionally used to treat them, like antibiotics. the significant risk to human health posed by ""antimicrobial resistance"" (amr) and its connection to and impact on agriculture will be discussed at a high-level un event on september 21st in new york. according to fao's action plan on antimicrobial resistance, released today: ""antimicrobial medicines play a critical role in the treatment of diseases of farm animals and plants. their use is essential to food security, to our well-being, and to animal welfare. however, the misuse of these drugs, associated with the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant micro-organisms, places everyone at great risk."" with much attention justifiably focused on exposure to amr pathogens in hospitals and similar settings, the presence of amr microorganisms in farming systems represents another vector  the food we eat, fao is stressing. and in addition to public health risks, amr has implications for both food safety and food security and the economic wellbeing of millions of farming households across the globe. fao's plan highlights four key areas for action in the food and agriculture sphere:improving awareness of amr issues among farmers and producers, veterinary professionals and authorities, policymakers, and food consumersbuilding national capacities for surveillance and monitoring of amr and antimicrobial use (amu) in food and agriculturestrengthening governance related to amu and amr in food and agriculturepromoting good practices in food and agricultural systems and the prudent use of antimicrobials the organization is aiming to help governments put in place national strategies for tackling amr and amu in their food and agricultural sectors by mid-2017. amr and food and agriculture as a result of economic expansion and population growth over the past 50 years, food production methods have intensified, resulting in an increase in the use of antimicrobials in agriculture. these medicines are used to treat animals that are already sick, or to prevent diseases from spreading further within a flock or on a farm. in addition to livestock, they are now employed in aquaculture  fish farms  in the same way. in some cases  albeit to a lesser degree  antimicrobial substances are spread on plant crops. additionally, antimicrobials are added in low concentrations to animal feed as a way to stimulate growth  a practice that is increasingly discouraged but still relatively common. estimated global antimicrobial consumption in the livestock sector current runs over 60,000 tonnes per year. with demand for animal-sourced food products projected to grow steadily over the coming decades, the use of antimicrobials will continue to rise, fao says. two-thirds of the estimated future expansion of antimicrobial usage is expected to occur within the animal production sector, with use in pigs and poultry is set to double, according one international study published by the u.s. national academy of sciences.challenges and needs fao is stressing that the fundamental way to address amr in food and agriculture is to ensure that farm and food systems adhere to best practices for hygiene, biosecurity, and animal care and handling. this reduces the need for antimicrobial medicines in the first place - as does vaccinating farm animals to build their natural ability to withstand disease. another key need is the lack of a global, standardized approach to data used to track the use of antimicrobials in livestock. the uk-government's o'neill commission report, for instance, found that only 42 countries have such systems in place. risks from amr in agriculture are higher in countries where laws, regulations and monitoring systems are weak. building national capacities in this regard is a priority focus for fao. more research and development into alternatives to antimicrobials and antibiotics in food and agriculture is also needed  as well efforts to plug gaping holes in our knowledge regarding the environmental pathways of amr in farm waste.ongoing work the fao-who codex alimentarius commission, which sets international food quality and safety standards, has already laid the foundations for food safety control authorities to tackle antimicrobial resistance in food  via a range of standards on amr, veterinary drugs and their residues, food hygiene, and animal feed. codex recently established a dedicated amr task force. as it has developed today's action plan, fao has also been intensifying its engagement with farming communities, public health and veterinary specialists, regulators and food safety inspectors on amr, holding workshops for example in cambodia, china, ethiopia, ghana, kenya, thailand, viet nam, and zimbabwe.",2021-04-16

""there is no significant slowdown because all the affected countries working with fao consider desert locusts a national priority,"" said cyril ferrand, fao's resilience team leader for east africa.   ""while lockdown is becoming a reality, people engaged in the fight against the upsurge are still allowed to conduct surveillance, and air and ground control operations.""   fao is augmenting national efforts by providing support for surveillance as well as aerial and ground spraying being conducted in 10 affected countries.  so far more than 240,000 hectares have been treated with chemical pesticides or biopesticides across the region and 740 people have been trained up to conduct ground locust control operations.  but covid-19 has had an impact on the supply of motorized sprayers and pesticides. ""the biggest challenge we are facing at the moment is the supply of pesticides and we have delays because global air freight has been reduced significantly,"" ferrand said.     ""our absolute priority is to prevent a breakdown in pesticide stocks in each country. that would be dramatic for rural populations whose livelihoods and food security depend on the success of our control campaign."" as covid-19 restricts the movement of personnel in the field, fao is intensifying remote data collection and the network of partners, civil society, extension workers and grassroot organizations is critical for providing information from remote locations especially in ethiopia, kenya, somalia and south sudan. fao is encouraging all countries to use elocust3, a rugged handheld tablet and app, which records and transmits data in real time via satellite to national locust centres and to the desert locust information service (dlis) based at fao headquarters in rome.  since 2015, more than 450 of these handheld devices have been distributed to teams in northern africa, the near east and southwest asia, allowing the transfer of real-time data from the middle of the desert directly to the national locust office and to fao's headquarters. more recently, fao has developed a version of elocust3 that can be used on mobile phones and a gps device in order to broaden usage and coverage. ""we need to rely on a network of partners in the field in order to collect vital information because we cannot go everywhere due to covid-19,"" ferrand said. the desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world and a single swarm covering one square kilometer contains up to 80 million locusts.   fao estimates the number of locusts could increase another 20 times during the upcoming rainy season unless control activities are stepped up. the current situation represents an unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods that could lead to further suffering, displacement and potential tensions. fao recently scaled up its desert locust appeal to $153.2 million and so far $111.1 million has been pledged or received.  funding has been received from belgium, canada, china, denmark, france, germany, italy, the netherlands, saudi arabia, sweden and switzerland as well as the abu dhabi agriculture and food safety authority, the african development bank, the africa solidarity trust fund, the european civil protection and humanitarian aid operation (echo), the european union, the bill & melinda gates foundation, the mastercard foundation, the uk department for international development (dfid), the un central emergency response fund (cerf) and usaid. desert locust monitoring, forecasting and control are at the heart of fao's mandate. its desert locust information service has been in operation for nearly 50 years. fao's well-established field presence, ability to link up authorities from different countries, and expertise in desert locust management, make it a key player in responding to upsurges like that currently affecting east africa.  note to editors: a video news release on fao's effort to contain the desert locust upsurge in kenya despite restrictions imposed by the covid-19 pandemic is available on fao's media vault at: http://tv.fao.org/",2021-04-16

""fish and fisheries products are recognized not only as some of the healthiest foods on the planet but also as some of the less impactful on the natural environment,"" says fao director-general qu dongyu, emphasizing that they must play a more central role in food security and nutrition strategies at all levels. the director-general also pointed to sofia's reporting of growing evidence that while effective fisheries management results in robust or rebuilding of fish stocks, failure to implement these measures threaten their contributions to food security and livelihoods. the underlying reasons for sustainability failures are complex and need tailored solutions. some 34.2 percent of fish stocks are now fished at biologically unsustainable levels, according to sofia's benchmark analysis. that overall measure is too high, and is not globally improving, although it's welcome to know that 78.7 percent of all fish landed come from biologically sustainable stocks. furthermore, sustainability trends for many major species are improving. catches of all kinds of tuna reached their highest level, about 7.9 million tonnes in 2018, and two thirds of the these stocks are now fished at biologically sustainable levels, a sharp increase of 10 percentage points in just two years, testament to intensive fisheries management in a sector marked by a high-value commodity and by significant overcapacity among some fleets. ""the improvement, the fruit of contributions from many stakeholders, attest to the importance of active management to reach and maintain biological sustainability, and serves to underscore how urgently we must replicate such approaches in fisheries and regions where management systems are in poor shape,"" said manuel barange, director of the fao fisheries and aquaculture department. ""not surprisingly, we notice that sustainability is particularly difficult in places where hunger, poverty and conflict exist, but there is no alternative to sustainable solutions.""covid-19while sofia is based on information before covid-19, the baseline information it provides is already helping fao respond with technical solutions and targeted interventions for fisheries and agriculture, which the director-general noted is one of the sectors most impacted by the pandemic. global fishing activity may have declined by around 6.5 percent as a result of restrictions and labor shortages due to the health emergency, according to an addendum to sofia published by fao.the disruption of international transport has impacted particularly on aquaculture production for export, while greatly reduced tourism and restaurant closures have dramatically impacted distribution channels for many fish types, although retail sales have remained stable or increased for frozen, canned, marinated and smoked fish with a longer shelf life. in parts of the mediterranean and the black sea, more than 90 percent of small-scale fishers have been forced to stop due to an inability to sell their catches, often exacerbated by falling prices.input markets, migrant labor issues and risks linked to crowded fresh markets all impact fisheries output and consumption, with informal supply chains under greater stress due to the absence of contractual relationships and established cold chains. fao has been primarily focused on supporting, restarting and strengthening the sector's supply chains and livelihoods, with priority attention for the most vulnerable groups and regions. trends in global fish supplythe sofia report has tomes of fishing data organized by species, regions and whether they are captured wild or farmed. global fish production is estimated to have reached about 179 million tonnes in 2018, with a total first sale value estimated at $401 billion. aquaculture products accounted for 46 percent of total production and 52 percent of fish for human consumption. china is by far the largest producer, buoyed by its highly-developed aquaculture industry, which has produced more farmed aquatic food than the rest of the world combined since 1991. aquaculture's expansion will continue, although at a slower rate, and farmed fish will contribute to a growing share of consumption and trade over the next decade, according to sofia. aquaculture output is expected to grow by 48 percent in africa, contributing to mitigate an expected population-driven reduction in per capita fish consumption on the continent. anchoveta was the top species for marine capture, buoyed by a strong production rebound in peru and chile, while alaska pollock and skipjack tuna were next. inland capture fisheries - a significant source of food in many food-limited countries- reached the highest level ever reported, at 12 million tonnes.  fish consumption accounts for one-sixth of the global population's intake of animal proteins, and more than half in countries such as bangladesh, cambodia, the gambia, ghana, indonesia, sierra leone, sri lanka and several small island developing states (sids). the significant dietary values of fish galvanize the importance of aquaculture development, especially in africa, and of harness strategies to help it intensify production sustainably using innovative techniques in the areas of feeds, genetic selection, biosecurity and business developments, fao's director-general emphasizes, noting that fao's hand-in-hand initiative is ""an ideal framework for efforts that combine fisheries and aquaculture trends and challenges in the context of blue growth.""the fao report has a section on sustainability initiatives to mark the 25th anniversary of the code of conduct for responsible fisheries, and also notes that fao and a host of partners are collaborating on the illuminating hidden harvests project, a global study that will be released in late 2020 and aims to support policies in favor of productive, sustainable and equitable small-scale fisheries, which can and do provide essential nutrition to billions and livelihoods and jobs for the vast majority of the 120 million people who depend on capture fisheries. key numbers from the state of world fisheries and aquaculture 2020-total global fish production in 2018: 179 million tonnes -share of that from marine capture fisheries: 84.4 million tonnes -from freshwater capture fisheries: 12.0 million tonnes, a record -from aquaculture: 82.1 million tonnes, a new high -amount of production consumed by humans as food: 156 million tonnes -first-sale value of all fisheries and aquaculture production in 2018: $401 billion -share of that from aquaculture: $250 billion -number of people employed in the primary sector of fisheries and aquaculture: 59.5 million, of whom 14% are women-region with the most fishers and fish farmers: asia (85% of the total) -number of fishing vessels on the planet: 4.56 million -largest fleet by region: asia (3.1 million vessels, or 68% of the global fleet) -share of motorized vessels less than 12 meters in length: 82% -percent of global fish production that enters international trade: 38% -value of fish production exports: $164 billion -world's largest fish producer and exporter: china -net fish exporting regions: oceania, latin america and caribbean, developing countries in asia -africa is a net importer in volume terms but a net exporter in value terms. -most unsustainable fisheries: mediterranean and black sea (62.5% overfished stocks), the southeast pacific (54.5%), southwest atlantic (53.3%) -riversheds supporting the most inland capture fishery production: mekong, nile, ayeyarwady, yangtze",2021-04-16
"159","Netherlands donates $28 million to build more resilient food systems in protracted crises","https://www.un.org/en/ga/, http://fsinplatform.org/","24 september 2019, new-york/rome - the kingdom of the netherlands has contributed $28 million to back fao's work to boost the resilience of food systems in somalia, sudan, and south sudan - part of a new initiative to scale-up resilience-based development work in countries affected by protracted crises.  in such contexts, humanitarian interventions often focus on meeting immediate and urgent needs, like providing shelter or food aid. in contrast, fao's food and nutrition security resilience programme: building food system resilience in protracted crises (fns repro) aims to show that development interventions centred on strengthening livelihoods over the longer-term can take place at a large scale - even in unstable operational theatres. the funding agreement was signed on monday by the minister for foreign trade and development cooperation of the netherlands, sigrid a.m. kaag, and fao director-general qu dongyu on the side-lines of the united nations general assembly in new york (17-30 september). ""countries and regions affected by protracted crises are often reliant on humanitarian aid and too frequently written off as places where agricultural and rural development cannot take place at scale. our work shows that is not true,"" qu said. ""we know it can. this is why this project includes a robust learning agenda that will help capture successful case studies that can be replicated in other communities facing similar challenges"". ""this is a major step forward in our collaborative effort to build on the security council's ground-breaking resolution last year on conflict and food security. through fns-repro, we'll be operationalizing a new way of working in humanitarian contexts, one that recognizes that sustained rural development initiatives -- even in situations of protracted instability -- have a key role to play in preventing and mitigating food crises,"" said kaag. fns-repro's work will unfold along three broad tracks: improving rural communities' access to and management of natural resources; generating enhanced and new livelihood opportunities along agricultural value chains; and enhancing people's capacity to explore and take advantage of those new opportunities. additionally, by helping communities identify and mitigate risks, improve their management of natural resources, establish more resilient livelihoods and increase local agricultural production, the project intends not only to improve food and nutrition security but also to contribute to reducing conflict and sustaining peace. a new approach to food insecurity in protracted crises  protracted crises are becoming a new norm- with 40 percent more food crises considered to be protracted than in 1990. food security responses consistently make up the largest share of un-coordinated humanitarian appeals, representing more than one-third of global humanitarian requirements at $7.4 billion in 2019.  these vital responses help ensure that immediate life-saving needs are met. however, frequently they are not design to supporting people in achieving long term food security or in building up their ability to cope with shocks. as a result, many assisted populations fall back into hunger shortly after humanitarian interventions wind down.  the new fao project is based on the premise that humanitarian, development and peace building efforts must be complimentary and mutually-reinforcing. such integrated efforts offer the most effective way to manage food crises. they are especially vital in rural areas where hunger is most prevalent and where most national food crises and famines start. this is why fao and partners are -- through the global network against food crises, an international partnership that seeks to tackle the root causes of acute hunger -- exploring ways to tackle food crises at their root, rather than only responding after they break out. fns-repro will make an important contribution to the network's efforts to reshape the way the international community works together to meet humanitarian needs, promote sustainable development and food security, and sustain peace.",2021-04-16

global food commodity prices rose sharply in november to their highest level in nearly six years, according to a benchmark united nations report released today.the fao food price index averaged 105.0 points during the month, up 3.9 percent from october and 6.5 percent higher than its value a year earlier. the monthly increase was the sharpest since july 2012, putting the index at its highest level since december 2014, the food and agriculture organization said. the fao food price index tracks changes in the international prices of the most globally traded food commodities. all of its sub-indices rose in november. the fao vegetable oil price index gained a stunning 14.5 percent in the month, led by an ongoing rally in palm oil prices linked to sharp contractions in world inventory levels. the fao cereal price index rose 2.5 percent from october and averaged 19.9 percent higher than in november 2019. wheat export prices rose, linked to reduced harvest prospects in argentina, as did maize prices on account of lower output expectations in the united states of america and ukraine as well as large purchases by china. international rice prices held steady during the month.the fao sugar price index rose 3.3 percent month-on-month amid growing expectations of a global production shortfall in the upcoming marketing season as unfavorable weather conditions drove weaker crop prospects in the european union, the russian federation and thailand. the fao dairy price index increased 0.9 percent to near an 18-month high, driven largely by firmer butter and cheese prices and surging retail sales in europe during a seasonal low period for milk production in the region. the fao meat price index rose 0.9 percent from october, but it is still 13.7 percent below its value a year ago. prices of bovine, ovine and pig meats all increased, while those of poultry meat declined.fao trims world 2020 cereal output forecastfao has further lowered its forecast for global cereal production in 2020, which now stands at 2 742 million tonnes - still a record high and 1.3 percent above the previous year's outturn. the new forecasts released today with fao's cereal supply and demand brief point to world coarse grains production of 1 470 million tonnes, wheat production of 761.7 million tonnes, and rice output of 508.4 million tonnes.looking ahead, planting of the northern hemisphere's winter wheat crop is underway and remunerative prices are expected to increase sowings in several major producing countries. however, crop conditions in the united states of america are moderately poorer due to dry weather conditions, influenced by the prevailing la niña weather phenomenon.world cereal utilization in 2020/21 is now forecast to rise to 2 744 million tonnes, up 1.9 percent from 2019/20, led by expectations of increasing feed use of maize and sorghum in china as well as a rise in the production of maize-based ethanol in brazil and the u.s.a.worldwide cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2021 are predicted to decline to 866.4 million tonnes, translating into a global stock-to-use ratio of 30.7 percent - which fao notes is a five-year low but still a relatively comfortable level.world trade in cereals in 2020/21 is forecast to rise 3.4 percent from the previous year to 454.6 million tonnes, driven primarily by a faster than expected pace in maize sales by the u.s.a. and continued strong purchases from china. covid-19, la niña and food insecuritythe impact of the covid-19 pandemic, particularly in terms of income losses, is an important driver of the levels of global food insecurity. the pandemic is exacerbating and intensifying already fragile conditions caused by conflicts, pests and weather shocks, including recent hurricanes in central america and floods in africa.forty-five countries, 34 of them in africa, continue to be in need of external assistance for food, according to the quarterly crop prospects and food situation report, also published today by fao's markets and trade division. according to the report, aggregate cereal production by the 51 low-income food-deficit countries is anticipated to grow this year to 496.3 million tonnes - some 7 percent higher than the last five-year average - thanks to large outputs in southern africa and far east asia. however, cereal import requirements in the 2020/21 marketing year are estimated to rise to 73.9 million tonnes, mostly reflecting increased needs among sub-saharan african countries. the report notes that the presence of la niña heightens the risk of above-average rainfall in southern africa and east asia, while parts of near east asia and east africa are expecting reduced rains, conditions that may result in adverse production shocks. the 45 countries in need of external assistance for food are: afghanistan, bangladesh, burkina faso, burundi, cabo verde, cameroon, central african republic, chad, congo, democratic people's republic of korea, democratic republic of congo, djibouti, eritrea, eswatini, ethiopia, guinea, haiti, iraq, kenya, lebanon, lesotho, liberia, libya, madagascar, malawi, mali, mauritania, mozambique, myanmar, namibia, niger, nigeria, pakistan, senegal, sierra leone, somalia, south sudan, sudan, syrian arab republic, united republic of tanzania, uganda, venezuela, yemen, zambia and zimbabwe.",2021-04-16

http://www.fao.org/ag/LOCUSTS/en/activ/DLIS/dailyphotos/index.html","25 july 2019, rome - desert locust summer breeding, amplified by heavy rains, can pose a serious threat to agricultural production areas of yemen, sudan, eritrea and parts of ethiopia and northern somalia during the next three months, fao warned today. this could result in potentially adverse impacts on the agricultural seasonal yields and local economies affecting food security and livelihoods of the populations in the countries concerned. intensive ground and aerial control operations were mounted in iran (712 000 ha), saudi arabia (219 000 ha) and sudan (105 000 ha) this year that undoubtedly reduced locust populations but could not entirely prevent swarms from forming and moving to the traditional summer breeding areas in yemen, sudan, the horn of africa and along both sides of the indo-pakistan border.  there is a moderate to high risk of the desert locust situation escalating further in the interior and coastal areas of yemen and in the interior of sudan, causing swarms to form that would threaten agricultural production by the end of the summer. this will be followed by further increases along both sides of the red sea during the upcoming winter from november onwards. yemen, the world's current worst humanitarian crisis, is the most concerned and at highest risk because of widespread hopper band infestations and heavy rainfall that will cause swarms to form from this week onwards, which could give rise to another generation of breeding by the end of august if weather conditions remain favourable to locust breeding.  in the worst-case scenario, swarms could migrate from yemen in the autumn to the horn of africa and reach kenya by the end of the year, unless urgent preventive and control measures are established in the region. desert locust swarms last invaded kenya in 2007 and aerial control operations were required to bring the situation under control. in northeast somalia, mature swarms were seen at several locations during the past weeks, causing substantial crop damage. hopper bands are now forming along the northwest coast and probably in the northeast from eggs laid by the swarms. this could give rise to new swarms by about late august.  similar breeding is expected to occur in eastern ethiopia while groups of adult locusts may move from the northern region of amhara to the summer breeding areas in western eritrea and the interior of sudan. in sudan, high numbers of adult populations are present in the nile valley while scattered adults appeared recently on the red sea coast and in north kordofan where summer breeding will occur.  dangerous creatures  after becoming airborne, swarms of tens of millions of locusts can fly up to 150 km a day with the wind. desert locusts (schistocerca gregaria) live about three months, and a female locust lays about 300 eggs. a desert locust adult can consume roughly its own weight in fresh food per day -- about two grams every day. a very small swarm eats the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. urgent action needed to prevent the spread and save crops  urgent desert locust control operations are required to safeguard crops and mitigate the risk of infestation in yemen, as well as to prevent locust swarms from invading the neighbouring countries.  in yemen, survey and control operations are hindered by insecurity in locust breeding areas and insufficient capacities such as equipment and operating funds. to partially address this, fao has rapidly mobilized $100 000, thanks to a contribution from belgium through the special fund for emergency and rehabilitation activities (sfera), and $200 000 from its own resources to mount a much-needed anti-locust campaign. fao is already implementing a number of urgent measures to support surveillance and control operations in the breeding areas.  the un agency  has also initiated the process of purchasing additional equipment to increase the capacity of the ministry of agriculture to enable timely control of locust in the infested areas. in addition, fao has launched a general appeal to the international community. the primary beneficiaries are farmers, livestock breeders and nomads who live in the desert locust infested areas, and whose livelihood will be protected from the damages that the increased locust infestations would cause to agricultural production and pastures. the assistance will help around 100 000 people in lahij, shabwah, hadramout, abyan, sana'a and al-hodeidah provinces in saving their crops, thus preventing crop losses, which can result in increased hunger and poverty in rural areas that are already impacted by ongoing conflict.  while sudan is much better equipped and prepared than some other countries in the region, the current political situation in the country may reduce the effectiveness of operations this summer. capacities in eritrea, ethiopia and northern somalia also remain relatively limited. given the seriousness of the current locust situation, all countries must monitor the field conditions by mounting regular ground surveys and undertaking the necessary control measures whenever important locust infestations are detected. fao operates a desert locust information service that receives and analyzes data from locust-affected countries to assess the current locust situation, provide forecasts and if necessary issue warnings and alerts in order to keep the global community informed of locust developments and threats.",2021-04-16
"163","Impact of water scarcity on food security a priority for Near East and North Africa meeting","","20 february 2014, rome - water scarcity is one of the most urgent food security issues facing countries of the near east and north africa (nena), with fresh water availability in the region expected to drop by 50 percent by the year 2050, said fao, as ministers of agriculture and national officials prepared to tackle the issue at a meeting of the organization's highest regional governing body. participants in the 32nd fao regional conference for the near east  (nerc-32), to be held from 24 to 28 february, are set to discuss a new regional water scarcity initiative, launched by fao to support member countries in identifying strategies, policies and practices that promote sustainable solutions to water scarcity and related food security problems.  per capita fresh water availability in countries of the near east and north africa has plummeted by two-thirds over the past 40 years, heightening concerns over the degradation of water quality and the impact of climate change. demographic trends are adding urgency to the issue: chronic undernourishment in the region is estimated at 11.2 percent, based on the 2010-2013 reporting period, while the population continues to grow at 2 percent, almost twice the global rate. farming and other agricultural activities consume more than 85 percent of available rainfed, irrigated and groundwater resources, and the demand for agricultural products is expected to grow amid burgeoning urban populations and increased exports. ""agriculture must be central to our responses to the challenge of water scarcity in the near east and north africa region. agriculture is by far the largest user of water in the region, but it is also fundamental to our survival and long-term resilience, accounting for some $95 billion in added value to regional economies,"" said abdessalam ould ahmed, fao assistant director-general and regional representative for the near east and north africa. ""the region has made significant strides in two decades in developing its water usage and storage capacities, but there is still much work to be done to improve water efficiency in agriculture, protect water quality, and address challenges related to climate change,"" ould ahmed added. conference participants are expected to offer guidance on priority areas for action, such as improving governance and institutions; giving more voice to farmers and other non-state stakeholders; and boosting efficiency in water use, both within and across national borders. more than 60 percent of the water resources used by countries in the region comes from outside of national and regional boundaries.   pilot initiative the pilot phase of the initiative, which was launched in june 2013, in six countries (egypt, jordan, morocco, oman, tunisia and yemen) began reviewing the current status of water availability and use and the potential for further agricultural production; identifying and ranking options for future food supply in terms of both their economic and water-requirement costs; and, looking at the performance of agriculture water management and relevant policies, governance and institutional issues.  work done under the initiative will encourage countries to learn from success stories in other countries to improve management and the use of rainfed, irrigated and groundwater systems through an innovative approach that includes:  the creation of a broad consensus on the water reform agenda among all involved stakeholders. the acknowledgement of farmers' role in prompting a shift in the way water resources are used and managed. the involvement of the private sector as the actual manager of the food value chain and the supplier of the latest available technologies. the establishment of partnerships which are action-oriented and results-based. the development of tools to concretely measure results and collect evidence to support policy-making and decision-making processes.regional perspectives the upcoming conference, whose theme is ""for a resilient and food secure region,"" will be the first of a series of meetings to be held in 2014 in each of the organization's five operational regions.  the agenda will also focus on the state of food and agriculture in the region and related issues like food losses and waste along the production-to-consumption chain; enhancing gender equality; and, other approaches to improving agricultural and rural development prospects.  the regional conferences meet every two years, bringing together ministers of agriculture and high officials of member states from the same geographic region on challenges that transcend national borders and priority matters related to food and agriculture. nerc 32 will include a three-day meeting for senior officers from 24 to 26 february, followed by a ministerial meeting on 27 and 28 february.",2021-04-16
"164","Report highlights growing role of fish in feeding the world","http://www.fao.org/2/i3720e, http://www.fao.org/fishery/code/en, http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/230743/icode/","19 may 2014, rome  more people than ever before rely on fisheries and aquaculture for food and as a source of income, but harmful practices and poor management threaten the sectors sustainability, says a new fao report published today.according to the latest edition of faos the state of world fisheries and aquaculture, global fisheries and aquaculture production totalled 158 million tonnes in 2012 - around 10 million tonnes more than 2010.the rapid expansion of aquaculture, including the activities of small-scale farmers, is driving this growth in production.fish farming holds tremendous promise in responding to surging demand for food which is taking place due to global population growth, the report says.at the same time, the planet's oceans  if sustainably managed  have an important role to play in providing jobs and feeding the world, according to fao's report.the health of our planet as well as our own health and future food security all hinge on how we treat the blue world, fao director-general josé graziano da silva said. we need to ensure that environmental well-being is compatible with human well-being in order to make long-term sustainable prosperity a reality for all. for this reason, fao is committed to promoting 'blue growth,' which is based on the sustainable and responsible management of our aquatic resources.the renewed focus on the so-called blue world comes as the share of fisheries production used by humans for food has increased from about 70 percent in the 1980s to a record high of more than 85 percent (136 million tonnes) in 2012.at the same time per capita fish consumption has soared from 10 kg in the 1960s to more than 19 kg in 2012.the new report also says fish now accounts for almost 17 percent of the global populations intake of protein -- in some coastal and island countries it can top 70 percent.fao estimates that fisheries and aquaculture support the livelihoods of 1012 percent of the worlds population.since 1990 employment in the sector has grown at a faster rate than the worlds population and in 2012 provided jobs for some 60 million people engaged in capture fisheries and aquaculture. of these, 84 percent were employed in asia, followed by africa with about 10 percent.capture fisheries stable, aquaculture boom continuesglobal marine capture fishery production was stable at about 80 million tonnes in 2012, the new report indicates.currently, under 30 percent of the wild fish stocks regularly monitored by fao are overfished  a reversal in trend observed during the past few years, a positive sign in the right direction. just over 70 percent are being fished within biologically sustainable levels. of these, fully fished stocks  meaning those at or very close to their maximum sustainable production  account for over 60 percent and underfished stocks about 10 percent.global aquaculture production marked a record high of more than 90 million tonnes in 2012, including almost 24 million tonnes of aquatic plants. china accounted for over 60 percent of the total share. aquacultures expansion helps improve the diets of many people, especially in poor rural areas where the presence of essential nutrients in food is often scarce. however, the report warns that to continue to grow sustainably, aquaculture needs to become less dependent on wild fish for feeds and introduce greater diversity in farmed culture species and practices. for example, small-sized species can be an excellent source of essential minerals when consumed whole. however, consumer preferences and other factors have seen a switch towards larger farmed species whose bones and heads are often discarded. the role of fish is set to feature prominently at the second international conference on nutrition jointly organized by fao and the world health organization (who) for 1921 november 2014 in rome. greater market share for developing countries, more attention to small-scale fishers fish remains among the most traded food commodities worldwide, worth almost $130 billion in 2012  a figure which likely will continue to increase.an important trend sees developing countries boosting their share in the fishery trade  54 percent of total fishery exports by value in 2012 and more than 60 percent by quantity (live weight).this means fisheries and fish farming are playing an increasingly critical role for many local economies. some 90 percent of fishers are small scale and it is estimated that, overall, 15 percent are women.  in secondary activities such as processing, this figure can be as high as 90 percent.fao, through the 2014 international year of family farming, is raising the profile of smallholder activities  including fisheries and aquaculture  with an emphasis on improving access to finance and markets, securing tenure rights and protecting the environment.reducing wastage, curbing harmful practices, improving traceabilityan estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food are lost per year -- to about one-third of all food produced. this figure includes post-harvest fish losses, which tend to be greater in small-scale fisheries.in small-scale fisheries, quality losses are often far more significant than physical losses. improved handling, processing and value-addition methods could address the technical aspects of this issue, but it is also vital to extend good practices, build partnerships, raise awareness, and develop capacity and relevant policies and strategies.the report also notes that illegal, unreported and unregulated (iuu) fishing remains a major threat to marine ecosystems and also impacts negatively on livelihoods, local economies and food supplies.food chain traceability is increasingly a requirement in major fish markets, especially in the wake of recent scandals involving the mislabelling of food products. fao provides technical guidelines on certification and ecolabelling which can help producers demonstrate that fish has been caught legally from a sustainably managed fishery or produced in properly run aquaculture facility.in particular, the report stresses the importance of the code of conduct for responsible fisheries which, since its adoption almost two decades ago, remains key to achieving sustainable fisheries and aquaculture. the code promotes the responsible use of aquatic resources and habitat conservation to help boost the sectors contribution to food security, poverty alleviation and human well-being.  fao is also promoting blue growth as a framework for ensuring sustainable and socioeconomically-sensitive management of oceans and wetlands.at the global oceans action summit on food security and blue growth held last month in the hague, netherlands, governments and other participants committed to actions focused on tackling climate change, overfishing, habitat loss and pollution in a bid to restore productive, resilient oceans.",2021-04-16

""japan is a global model for healthy diets,"" he said. ""japan currently has the lowest rate of obesity among developed countries. you are below four percent.""  graziano da silva noted how japan has a healthy and ""unique"" food culture, one that includes many vegetables, fruits and fish. he cited washoku, a comprehensive set of skills, knowledge and traditions relating to the preparation and consumption of food, which has been designated as an intangible cultural heritage by unesco. washoku is based on a ""respect for nature"" and is composed of fresh, seasonally available, low-fat ingredients, which together represent a well-balanced diet.  the fao director-general made the remarks during a visit to tokyo's sophia university. he noted that japan has a wealth of knowledge and experience to share with other countries - an interaction fao is keen to promote as an activity related to the united nations decade on nutrition. the decade aims to address poor dietary habits, which have been closely linked to non-communicable diseases  - including heart attacks strokes, cancers and diabetes -  a leading cause of premature death, not only in high-income countries, but also increasingly in many parts of the developing world. these diets buy phentermine online without prescription are typically not only unhealthy, but environmentally unsustainable. in this context, japan exemplifies how effective public policies and legislation can promote adequate nutrition, especially through laws aimed at educating children and controlling adults' weight, the fao director-general said.  such measures, are in line with commitments made by world leaders at the 2014 second international conference on nutrition and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, to establish national policies aimed at eradicating malnutrition and transforming food systems to make nutritious diets available to all. japan's strong contribution to fao's work in developing countries and crises areas in his address, graziano da silva praised japan for supporting developing countries through fao in the areas of food production and consumption as well as with regards to the agricultural sectors, including forestry, fisheries, livestock, land and water. for example, in afghanistan, japan has contributed more than $100 million to fao's agricultural interventions, especially with efforts to rehabilitate the country's irrigation infrastructure.  in myanmar, funds from the japanese government have helped fao deliver emergency and livelihood-rebuilding assistance - including high-quality seeds and fertilizers - to rural households affected by flooding and conflicts. in tokyo, graziano da silva also attended a tasting event hosted by the government of japan where he enjoyed sweets made using fruits produced in fukushima prefecture. in march 2011, fukushima in the northern part of japan was hit by earthquakes and tsunami that caused an accident at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant.  today, the fao director-general noted how the government of japan is making its utmost effort to recover from the disaster. ""at the moment, there is no reason to raise concern over food safety. inspections are continuous, a monitoring system is in place, and international protocols are being followed,"" he said.  fao national goodwill ambassadors for japan during his visit, graziano da silva also announced the appointment of hiroko kuniya and katsuhiro nakamura as the first-ever fao national goodwill ambassadors for japan. in this position, they are expected to play a role in promoting fao's development messages.  ms kuniya became well-known as a television news-anchor for the nhk japan network, including on the acclaimed ""today's close-up"" programme, covering poverty, hunger and other social issues. more recently she has worked as a journalist covering topics related to the sustainable development goals. mr nakamura initially became famous as the first japanese chef to receive a one-star restaurant recognition by michelin in 1979 in paris. he later returned to japan and in 2008 was named head chef during the g8 summit in toyako, hokkaido. he is a founder of the ryori volunteer no kai (food volunteer group) of which member chefs voluntarily visit disaster areas in japan and serve food. they also hold charity dinners in tokyo to collect funds for people in need.  earlier today, the fao director-general also attended the launch of the fao parliamentarian friendship league in japan. yoshimasa hayashi, former minister for agriculture, forestry and fisheries from 2012 to 2015, will serve as the chairman of the league. he and some 40 parliamentarians gathered to exchange views with the fao director-general. the un agency looks forward to working with the league to ""promote nutritious food including in neighbouring countries and regions,"" graziano da silva said.",2021-04-16

""we look forward to this group demonstrating strong leadership and advancing the global response to amr, by sustaining the political momentum, building public support and mobilizing resources at all levels,"" said fao's qu dongyu at the opening of the meeting. qu stressed that covid-19 had highlighted the inter-connectedness of the agri-food and health systems at every level, and this was very relevant to managing amr, which he described both as a ""slow-moving pandemic"" and a ""serious threat"".antimicrobial drugs are key in the treatment of diseases, and their use is essential to protect both human and animal health. however, antimicrobials' misuse and management is a major concern as a risk for emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant micro-organism.whilst acknowledging that bringing attention to amr in the midst of covid-19 might seem challenging, this is an opportunity, said the fao chief, as the world is more sensitized to the fragility of our health systems and the need to collectively tackle any threats to them. ""there is no time to waste. let's join our forces and work together - all for one health, and one health for all!"" he urged.qu also underlined that controlling amr was important to fao who is supporting its members through the ""four betters"" - better production, better nutrition, better environment, and better life.who's director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus cautioned that the world could not afford another global crisis, and urged political leaders, private sector and civil society to work together to address the drivers of amr, and apply a coordinated approach to increase investments across the one health spectrum in the implementation of national action plans, research and development. oie's director general monique eloit said that the group's expertise could help advocate the prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials, and the professional oversight of their use in all sectors. she pointed to the fight against amr being a perfect example of a concrete application of the one health multisectoral approach at global and national levels. the group's co-chairs mia amor mottley, prime minister of barbados and sheikh hasina, prime minister of bangladesh opened the meeting.mia amor mottley who also moderated the meeting said amr was a clear and present danger to people, animals, plants and the environment, and there was a need for a movement to see a transformational change in the fight against the amr crisis. for her part, sheikh hasina warned that amr could endanger all the significant advancements of modern medicine.unep's executive director inger andersen said her agency was pleased to join this partnership, noting that the natural environment was something that could not be ignored when dealing with amr as the environment was key to solving it. what's in store for the group? some of the objectives and actions envisaged for the group - to be refined on the second day of the meeting and in further exchanges - include:-to maintain urgency, public support, political momentum and visibility of the amr challenge on the global agenda;-to advocate for action and scaled-up investment, including support for the expanding work of the tripartite organizations (fao/oie/who), un environment and other international and regional entities;-to monitor and report on progress, gaps and accountability in the global response to amr;-to advocate for multi-stakeholder engagement with the participation of member states, un agencies, international and intergovernmental organizations and regional entities, civil society, the private sector, researchers and others to develop and work towards a shared global vision, goals and coordinated action on amr;-to monitor and advocate for the inclusion of amr and one health ""lens"" in investments and programmes of major financing instruments for agriculture, health, development, food and feed production.the health of animals, people, plants and the environment is interconnected. one health is an integrated approach that recognizes this fundamental relationship and ensures that specialists in multiple sectors work together to tackle health threats to animals, humans, plants and the environment. fao's work on amrthere has been a lot of attention on human exposure to amr pathogens in hospitals and other healthcare facilities and the ramifications related to public health. however, because of the presence of some antimicrobial resistant microorganisms in some agricultural practices, they may also be in the food we eat. antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms can develop in our food chain and move between animals, humans, and the environment. this makes amr a problem that crosses sectoral boundaries.fao, itself a multidisciplinary organization, brings into play its expertise in aquatic and terrestrial livestock health and production, crop production, natural resource management and food safety. an important area for fao's work is to identify and address the critical information gaps on the subject. moreover, fao is working closely with key partners such as oie, who and others in a global response to the threat of amr.the tripartite organizations (fao/oie/who) launched the one health global leader group as part of their shared call for united action to preserve and protect antimicrobial medicines. the group was created in response to a recommendation from the interagency coordination group on antimicrobial resistance and supported by secretary-general of the united nations.more information on the work of the tripartite is available here.",2021-04-16

""let us promote sustainable soil management rooted in proper soil governance and sound investments.  together, we can promote the cause of soils, a truly solid ground for life,"" un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a message for world soil day.  soils are vital for producing nutritious crops and they filter and clean tens of thousands of cubic kilometres of water each year. as a major storehouse for carbon, soils also help regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, thus fundamental for regulating climate.      yet the overwhelming conclusion of the report is that the majority of the world's soil resources are in only fair, poor or very poor condition and that conditions are getting worse in far more cases than they are improving. in particular, 33 percent of land is moderately to highly degraded due to erosion, salinization, compaction, acidification, and chemical pollution of soils.     ""further loss of productive soils would severely damage food production and food security, amplify food-price volatility, and potentially plunge millions of people into hunger and poverty. but the report also offers evidence that this loss of soil resources and functions can be avoided,"" said fao director-general josé graziano da silva. writing the foreword to the 650 page-long report, he expressed the conviction that the contents will ""greatly assist in galvanizing action at all levels towards more sustainable soil management,"" adding that this was in line with the international community's commitment to achieve the sustainable development goals.the impact of population growth, urbanization and climate changechanges to the condition of soils are primarily driven by population growth and economic growth, factors that are expected to persist in the decades to come.  the report notes how to feed a global population that has grown to some 7.3 billion today, over 35 percent of the earth's ice-free land area has been converted to agriculture. the result is that soils that have been cleared of natural vegetation to grow crops or graze livestock suffer from sharp increases in erosion and steep losses in soil carbon, nutrients and soil biodiversity. but urbanization is also taking a major toll. the rapid growth of cities and industries has degraded increasingly wide areas, including by contaminating soils with excess salt, acidity and heavy metals; compacting them under heavy machinery; and sealing them permanently under asphalt and concrete.   climate change - which is currently the focus of the un cop21 conference in paris - is a further strong driver of soil change, the report finds.  higher temperatures and related extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and storms impact on soil quantity and fertility in a number of ways, including reducing moisture and depleting the layers of nutrient-rich topsoil. they also contribute to an increase in the rate of soil erosion and shoreline retreat. achieving healthy soilsthe report focuses on the 10 main threats to soil functions: soil erosion, soil organic carbon loss, nutrient imbalance, soil acidification, soil contamination, waterlogging, soil compaction, soil sealing, salinization and loss of soil biodiversity. it notes how there is a general consensus on soil-related strategies that can, on the one hand, increase the supply of food, while on the other, minimize harmful environmental impacts. the solution proposed is one that centres on sustainable soil management and which requires the participation of a broad level of stakeholders ranging from governments to small-holder farmers. erosion, for example, can be curbed by reducing or eliminating tillage - digging, stirring, and overturning of soil - and using crop residues to protect the soil surface from the effects of rain and winds. similarly, soils suffering from nutrient deficits can be restored and yields increased by returning crop residues and other organic material to the soil, employing crop rotation with nitrogen-fixing crops, and making judicious use of organic and mineral fertilizers. the report identifies four priorities for action:  minimize further degradation of soils and restore the productivity of soils that are already degraded in regions where people are most vulnerable;stabilize global stores of soil organic matter, including both soil organic carbon and soil organisms;stabilize or reduce global use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer, while increasing fertilizer use in regions of nutrient deficiency; and,improve our knowledge about the state and trend of soil conditions. such actions need to be supported by targeted policies, including: support for the development of soil information systems to monitor and forecast soil change;increasing education and awareness on soil issues, by integrating this into formal education and across the curriculum - from geology to geography, from biology to economics.investing in research development and extension, to develop test, disseminate sustainable soil management technologies and practices.introducing appropriate and effective regulation and incentives. this could include taxes that discourage harmful practices such as excessive use of fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides. zoning systems can be used to protect the best agricultural soil from urban sprawl. subsidies could be used to encourage people to purchase tools and other inputs that have a less harmful impact on soils, while certification of sustainable crop and livestock practices can make produce more commercially attractive at higher prices.supporting achievement of local, regional and international food security by considering countries' soil resources and their capacities to manage them sustainably.some of the reports key findings:erosion carries away 25 to 40 billion tonnes of topsoil every year, significantly reducing crop yields and the soils ability to store and cycle carbon, nutrients, and water. annual cereal production losses due to erosion have been estimated at 7.6 million tonnes lost each year. if action is not taken to reduce erosion, a total reduction of over 253 million tonnes of cereals could be projected by 2050. this yield loss would be equivalent to removing 1.5 million square kilometres of land from crop production  or roughly all the arable land in india.lack of soil nutrients is the greatest obstacle to improving food production and soil function in many degraded landscapes. in africa, all but three countries extract more nutrients from the soil each year than are returned through use of fertilizer, crop residues, manure, and other organic matter. accumulation of salts in the soil reduces crop yields and can completely eliminate crop production. human-induced salinity affects an estimated 760,000 square kilometres of land worldwide  an area larger than all the arable land in brazil.soil acidity is a serious constraint to food production worldwide. the most acidic topsoils in the world are located in areas of south america that have experienced deforestation and intensive agriculture.",2021-04-16

""the competition among banana producing countries is fierce and many have struggled to remain competitive, but there are also new opportunities, as the market is no longer dominated by big players - and new buyers are entering the market,"" says ekaterina krivonos, an economist at the trade and markets division of fao.   economists in the secretariat of fao's intergovernmental group on bananas and tropical fruits conducted the analysis amid a flurry of reports on the merger last month of chiquita, the largest banana trading company in the world and the dominant company in the us market (61 percent of the company's sales), and fyffes, one of the main suppliers to the european market.  trading places the information note shows that the scope of operations of the big multinationals has also undergone a significant shift, away from plantation ownership and production, and more towards post-production logistics, including purchasing from producers, transportation, facilities to ripen the fruit, and marketing. major supermarket chains in the united states and the european union, meanwhile, have become ""important players in the global banana trade as they dominate the retail market in the main banana-consuming countries and are also increasingly purchasing from smaller wholesalers or directly from growers,"" the note underscores. this shift of market power away from the major banana brands towards retailers was facilitated by the establishment of direct container liner services from banana producing regions to the main destination markets. moreover, there is a parallel trend towards less concentration among the exporting firms in the major banana producing countries, for example in ecuador. in the information note, fao points out that while the merger that formed chiquitafyffes made the new company an undisputed leader in the banana market, with 18.7 percent control of global banana exports, ""it is unlikely that the merger will give the new company sufficient market power to exert pressure over the banana market and influence either producer prices or import/wholesale prices, given the importance of other market actors, in particular in europe and russia."" support for smaller producers as banana markets become more fragmented and new players continue to enter the fray, there is an important message for banana producers.  ""in order to seize opportunities in an increasingly competitive market, banana producers need to be better informed and better prepared, including smallholder producers and any cooperatives or other organizations that represent them,"" said kaison chang, secretary of the fao intergovernmental group on bananas and tropical fruits.  ""fao is working with governments and producers to help them build their viability by maintaining good cultivation practices, preventing and fighting plant diseases, strengthening producer organizations and developing both domestic and international marketing strategies,"" chang said.  ""in this changing market structure, it is vital that smallholders, as well as producer organizations, receive support in all of these areas, in order to be fully included in their national economies and to build the resilience of farming families in the banana industry.""",2021-04-16

sigatoka disease, which has ravaged banana and plantain production in the caribbean, vulnerable people could face food insecurity if the disease situation is allowed to further deteriorate. black sigatoka disease is considered one of the most dangerous diseases of banana and plantain. it spread from asia and reached the caribbean in 1991. smallholder banana farmers were unable to shoulder the expense of fighting the disease on their own, and banana farms have been decimated. the banana industry in the caribbean had been struggling for a long time, but the introduction of black sigatoka was the straw that broke the camels back, said vyjayanthi lopez, plant production and protection officer for the fao sub-regional office for the caribbean, who oversaw a regional programme to assist countries in dealing with the emergency. the countries included were: dominica, grenada, st. lucia, st. vincent and the grenadines in the antilles as well as guyana, in mainland south america.  the banana industrys main safeguards, particularly research and development, have become weak due to funding constraints. and with no strong voice to advocate for these farmers, the banana industry especially on the islands will have difficulty to recover, she said. banana farming and service jobs generated by banana production are vital to vulnerable families incomes and thus food security. for example, in st. vincent and the grenadines, 70 percent of arable land is set aside for banana production, generating 70 percent of employment on the islands. in 1990, st. vincent and the grenadines alone exported nearly 80 000 tonnes of bananas. by 2011, the total exports of all five countries requesting fao assistance decreased to less than 25 000 tonnes. grenada now has no banana exports, while in 1990 the country exported 8400 tonnes. guyana had lost 100 percent of its plantain exports prior to actions taken under the fao project. the caribbean island countries meanwhile saw similar declines of 90 to 100 percent of their banana and plantain exports, and trade practically ground to a halt. currently the most serious banana disease black sigatoka does particularly well in hot and humid climates and often spreads due to informal trade among the islands.  the disease first appears as narrow streaks and black spots, which as they proliferate can eventually blacken entire leaves of bananas and plantains, blocking photosynthesis. banana bunches are smaller, as are the fruit, and due to premature ripening that can occur even while the fruit is still on the tree, the bananas are no longer suitable for export.  small farms supplying to big business smallholders produce the bulk of these bananas that used to be destined for importers in north america and europe. even before black sigatoka, however, many smallholder farmers were already struggling to cope after repeated natural disasters, from hurricanes to floods and droughts, as well as a loss of traditional export markets. the spread of black sigatoka contributed to many of these farmers abandoning their banana fields as they simply dont have the resources for costly fungicide treatments that have helped keep other major banana exporters in business. central american exporters, for example, have survived largely thanks to weekly fungicide spraying to protect each newly-emerging leaf. improper use of fungicides to control https://globerx24.com/ black sigatoka can eventually lead to the pathogens developing resistance to those very same fungicides, rendering them ineffective. in addition, fungicides can lead to soil degradation and pollution of the wider environment. they are not sustainable over the long-term. a major staple food worldwide bananas are the worlds number four staple food, after rice, wheat and maize. annual production is estimated at some 107 million tonnes, with just 16 million tonnes destined for international markets at a value of nearly $us 9 billion. some 37 million tonnes of plantains are produced globally each year. international trade in bananas relies almost exclusively on one type of banana, the cavendish sub-group, which has been bred to suit consumer palates and aesthetic demands in developed countries. the cavendish is also more durable for long-distance international transport than local breeds, which can bruise and spoil. however, the cavendish is extremely susceptible to several banana diseases, black sigatoka included. the future of bananas and plantains in the caribbean some larger and wealthier neighbours in the caribbean have been able to counter economic damage from the loss of export markets due to black sigatoka disease. the dominican republic, for example, has focused on developing organic banana production, using modern crop management techniques, rather than fungicides, to protect their cavendish varieties.  guyana, meanwhile, looks positioned to regain export markets for its plantains in two to three years, as the government has taken on the fao-recommended strategy and action plan, and has funnelled its greater resources into reviving this key industry for the country. cuba and jamaica have instead shifted almost entirely to resistant banana and plantain cultivars instead of cavendish varieties to ensure food security for their local populations. they recognized early on that black sigatoka posed a threat to internal food security, not just to export income. building resistant bananas there could be reprieve worldwide if scientists were finally able to breed bananas that are similar to the cavendish in texture, taste and durability, but which possess genetic resistance to this banana disease. this is all the more important since banana producing countries are facing another threat:  a new strain of panama disease  tropical race 4. it was originally confined to east asia, but recently there have been reports that it has been found on a banana farm in jordan and a banana farm in mozambique. in both cases, authorities say the disease has been isolated. it is suspected that it could spread further and eventually reach latin america and the caribbean just like many other diseases have done in the past.",2021-04-16
"173","New Global Partnership for Preparedness launched","https://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/","24 may 2016, istanbul - a major new partnership to better prepare countries and communities for disasters is being launched today at the world humanitarian summit as a united response to a continuing rise in humanitarian emergencies. the new global partnership for preparedness (gpp) is led by the vulnerable twenty (v20) group of ministers of finance of the climate vulnerable forum, which represents 43 high-risk developing nations, in collaboration with a number of un agencies. these include the food and agriculture organization (fao), the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (unocha), the united nations development programme (undp) and the world food programme (wfp) as well as the world bank's global facility for disaster reduction and recovery (gfdrr). the partnership will strengthen preparedness capacities initially in 20 countries, so they attain a minimum level of readiness by 2020 for future disaster risks mainly caused by climate change. roberto b. tan, treasurer of the philippines, representing the chair of the v20, says that the goal of the partnership with the international community is to make sure that when disasters strike, the mechanisms and support are in place so people can get back on their feet as soon as possible, therefore minimizing the impact on development gains and preventing uncontrolled humanitarian crises. ""we know investment in preparedness saves lives and dollars and thus makes financial and economic sense. if we plan ahead, we will create a situation where instead of wave after wave of climate-driven natural disasters destroying what gains communities have made, they can pick up their lives again as soon as possible. crises such as those from natural disasters and effects of climate change should no longer spin out of control,"" treasurer tan says. united nations development program administrator helen clark says: ""this partnership will help countries to reach an adequate level of preparedness for disasters and other shocks. the aim is to save lives, safeguard development gains, and reduce the economic impacts of crises. importantly, this also safeguards development gains, which can otherwise be lost with each disaster, she said. ""this new partnership puts at-risk countries in the driver's seat and brings together the work of development and humanitarian actors in a coherent way."" stephen o'brien, united nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator states: ""extreme weather and other shocks shouldn't become major humanitarian disasters if we better anticipate and plan for them ahead, and reinforce local response capacity. the global preparedness partnership led by countries most at risk of climate change through the v20 provides a key opportunity to make this happen"".laura tuck, vice president for sustainable development at the world bank adds: ""at the initiative of the vulnerable twenty group of countries, we are joining un agencies to support a global preparedness partnership to help build strong national and local institutions and ensure that planning and financing for preparedness are integral parts of countries' disaster management frameworks."" ""the world's population that depends on farming, livestock, fishing and forests for their food and livelihoods, are highly vulnerable to natural disasters, whether provoked by extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods or earthquakes. agriculture remains a key economic activity for millions of people across the developing world and the bedrock of food security,"" said fao director-general josé graziano da silva. ""this new effort will help build up the resilience of rural communities and boost national capacities to prepare for problems and respond effectively to disasters when they occur,"" he added. ""as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, there is a need to shift from a focus on crisis response to taking anticipatory actions to manage risks. the global preparedness partnership recognizes that predictable finance and strengthened government capacity are essential for saving lives and reducing the cost of responding to disasters"", concludes ertharin cousin, executive director of the un world food programme. the partnership will become operational later this year and seeks to provide the initial 20 countries with support to achieve:  better access to risk analysis and early warning; contingency plans with clear lines of responsibility, triggers for action, and pre-committed finance; developing social protection, basic services and delivery systems capable of responding to shocks.",2021-04-16

""as the host of the cfs secretariat and one of its funders, fao strongly values the committee's potential, as a unique global platform for multi-stakeholder engagement, in the fight against hunger and malnutrition,"" he said. cfs instruments the director-general also noted the importance of translating cfs products and recommendations into concrete action on the ground, at regional, country, and local levels, which requires the strong engagement of all stakeholders, including governments, civil society and the private sector.  ""this means integrating the cfs policy frameworks, as appropriate, into national dialogues, legislative frameworks, as well as national, regional and global development efforts,"" he said, alluding to the cfs guidelines on land tenure, the cfs principles for responsible investments in agriculture and food systems , the framework for action for food security and nutrition in protracted crises and the cfs voluntary guidelines on food systems and nutrition, which are expected to be endorsed on wednesday. qu highlighted that all cfs products should always rely on clear science and evidence and stated that fao is ready to support the committee on the main topics in its agenda for 2021: reducing inequalities, youth engagement and data systems.  new fao the director-general also spoke about the fundamental transformative action fao has taken over the last 18 months to refocus its efforts in alignment with the organization's original mandate to eradicate hunger and poverty.  as an example, the director-general pointed to the fao's evidence-based, country-led and country-owned hand-in-hand initiative, which aims to accelerate agricultural, transformation and sustainable rural development, accompanied by its state-of-the-art digital tools, including the hand-in-hand geospatial platform, the data lab for statistical innovation and earth map.  among other notable developments, qu cited fao's holistic covid-19 response and recovery programme, which harnesses science, technology, data, human enterprise and creativity; as well as  the organization's recently introduced new strategy for private sector engagement to enhance strategic partnerships towards achieving the sustainable development goals. ""we strongly believe that accelerating and scaling up science, technology and innovation is key to meeting the aspiration of transforming our agri-food systems and moving towards achieving the sdgs, especially sdg1 (no poverty), sdg2 (no hunger) and sdg10 (reduced inequalities),"" he said. the director-general also welcomed nine countries who have recently joined the cfs, namely croatia, djibouti, honduras, latvia, maldives, moldova, saint lucia, saint vincent and the grenadines, and ukraine. other speakers during the opening session, un special envoy to the un food systems summit agnes kalibata delivered a message on behalf of united nations secretary-general antónio guterres in which he underscored that 2021 would be pivotal for achieving sdg2 (eradicating hunger) as food security and nutrition were the most pressing development, security and human rights issues of our time.  he called for fundamental systematic change to address hunger, sustainability and malnutrition while respecting human rights, alleviating poverty and supporting inclusive and sustainable development for all which he said were core to his thinking behind the food systems summit later this year in new york, and the pre-summit in rome in july. ""the committee on world food security has an important role to play in this summit, from the reports of its high-level panel of experts, to the policy convergence products,"" guterres added.  for his part, cfs chair and permanent representative of thailand to the un agencies in rome, thanawat tiensin, stressed that the work of cfs has never been more relevant than before, as the committee can provide evidence-based policy guidance to overcome current challenges and uncertainties ahead. he added that the un food systems summit 2021 in september would be an opportunity to build on this momentum. president of international fund for agricultural development (ifad) gilbert f. houngbo referred to the current pandemic as the wake up call to address the multiple complex challenges facing food systems and underlined the need for making them more resilient and responsive to the needs of consumers and producers alike.  in his video address, executive director of  the world food programme (wfp) david beasley said that the combined effects of climate change, conflict and now the covid-19 pandemic have caused a lot of damage on affected communities around the world, stressing the vital role cfs must play to address this global humanitarian crisis while pledging his support to the committee's critical work.  the chair of the cfs high-level panel of experts (hlpe) steering committee martin cole presented the key outcomes of the hlpe's new report on ""food security and nutrition: building a global narrative towards 2030"". the report is based on the analysis of food security and nutrition concepts, outcomes, drivers and critical policy directions that are vital for meeting sdg 2 targets and the entire 2030 agenda. he noted that according to the report we are not on track to reach the agenda 2030 underlining that business as usual will not be enough while pointing to the need for a transformative change to our food systems.  about cfs47 cfs is the foremost inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for all stakeholders to work together to ensure food security and nutrition for all. the 47th session (8-11 february) comes against a background of the unprecedented challenges posed by the impacts of the current covid-19 pandemic on our food systems and livelihoods of millions of people worldwide.  during a four-days long session, the committee is expected to endorse new voluntary guidelines on food systems and nutrition, resulting from an inclusive multistakeholder negotiation process, and informed by the scientific input of the cfs high level panel of experts and a technical task team from among the cfs advisory group constituencies.  these guidelines will serve as a significant reference point for countries and others in their efforts to eradicate all forms of hunger and malnutrition by utilizing a ""food systems"" approach.  the guidelines will also be an important contribution to the un food systems summit scheduled to take place in september this year.  the committee will also initiate work to develop new voluntary guidelines on gender equality and women's empowerment as related to food security and nutrition.",2021-04-16
"175","Putting family farmers first to eradicate hunger","http://www.fao.org/publications/sofa/en/","16 october  2014, rome -nine out of ten of the world's 570 million farms are managed by families, making the family farm the predominant form of agriculture, and consequently a potentially crucial agent of change in achieving sustainable food security and in eradicating hunger in the future, according to a new u.n. report released today.  family farms produce about 80 percent of the world's food. their prevalence and output mean they ""are vital to the solution of the hunger problem"" afflicting more than 800 million people, fao director-general josé graziano da silva wrote in the introduction to fao's new state of food and agriculture 2014 report. family farms are also the custodians of about 75 percent of all agricultural resources in the world, and are therefore key to improved ecological and resource sustainability. they are also among the most vulnerable to the effects of resource depletion and climate change. while evidence shows impressive yields on land managed by family farmers, many smaller farms are unable to produce enough to provide decent livelihoods for the families. family farming is thus faced with a triple challenge: yield growth to meet the world's need for food security and better nutrition; environmental sustainability to protect the planet and to secure their own productive capacity; and productivity growth and livelihood diversification to lift themselves out of poverty and hunger. according to the sofa report, all these challenges mean that family farmers must innovate.  ""in all cases, family farmers need to be protagonists of innovation as only this way can they take ownership of the process and ensure that the solutions offered respond to their needs,"" graziano da silva said. ""family farming is a key component of the healthy food systems we need to lead healthier lives."" the report calls for the public sector, working with farmers, civil society organizations and the private sector, to improve innovation systems for agriculture. agricultural innovation systems include all the institutions and actors that support farmers in developing and adopting better ways of working in today's increasingly complex world. innovation capacity must be promoted at various levels, with incentives for farmers, researchers, advisory service providers and integrated value chains to interact and create networks and partnerships to share information, sofa says.  policy makers must also consider the diversity of family farms in terms of size, technologies used, and integration into markets, as well as their ecological and socio-economic settings. this diversity means that farmers need different things from an innovation system. still, all farms need better governance, macroeconomic stability, physical and institutional market infrastructure, education as well as basic agricultural research, according to sofa.  public investment in agricultural research as well as extension and advisory services - which should be designed to be more participatory - must be increased to emphasize sustainable intensification and closing the yield and labor productivity gaps characterizing farm sectors in many developing nations. although agricultural research by private companies is increasing, public-sector investment remains indispensable to ensure research in areas of little interest to the private sector - such as basic research, orphan crops or sustainable production practices. such research constitutes a public good with many potential beneficiaries.family farms are vital the fao report offers a rich set of new details about family farms. most family farms are small. eighty-four percent of the world's farms are less than two hectares in size. however, farm sizes vary widely. indeed, farms larger than 50 hectares - including many family farms -  occupy two-thirds of the world's agricultural land.   in many high-income and upper-middle-income countries, large farms, responsible for most agricultural production, account for most farm land. but in most low- and lower-middle-income countries, small and medium-sized farms occupy most farm land and produce most of the food. small farms produce a higher share of the world's food relative to the share of land they use, as they tend to have higher yields than larger farms within the same countries and agro-ecological settings.  however, the higher productivity of land on family farms involves lower labor productivity, which perpetuates poverty and hinders development. much of the world's food production involves of unpaid labor by family members. the report emphasizes that it is imperative to boost output per worker, especially in low-income countries, in order to lift farm incomes and expand rural economic welfare in general.  currently, farm sizes are becoming smaller and smaller in most developing countries, where many smallholder farm households derive the bulk of their income from off-farm activities.  policies should aim to increase access to inputs such as seeds and fertilizers as well as to markets and credit, according to sofa. effective and inclusive producer organizations can support innovation by members, helping them gain access to markets, and facilitating linkages with others in the innovation system, besides ensuring that family farms have a voice in policy making, the report emphasizes.  to encourage family farmers to invest in sustainable agricultural practices, which often have high start-up costs and long pay-off periods, authorities should seek to provide an enabling environment for innovation. policies meant to catalyze innovation will need to go beyond technology transfer, according to sofa. they must also be inclusive and tailored to local contexts, so that farmers have ownership of innovation, and take gender and intergenerational issues into consideration, involving youth in the future of the agricultural sector.",2021-04-16

""global agriculture has evolved into a highly diverse sector, with operations ranging from small subsistence farms to large multinational holdings,"" fao director-general josé graziano da silva and oecd secretary-general angel gurría write in the foreword of the report. along with providing food, they added, today's farmers ""are important custodians of the natural environment and have become producers of renewable energy.""the outlook projects that yield improvements and higher production intensity, driven by technological innovation, will result in higher output even as global agricultural land use remains broadly constant. direct greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, meanwhile, are expected to grow by some 0.5 percent annually over the coming decade, below the 0.7 percent rate of the past 10 years and below the projected output growth rate - indicating declining carbon intensity. at the same time, new uncertainties are emerging on top of the usual risks facing agriculture. these include disruptions from trade tensions, the spread of crop and animal diseases, growing resistance to antimicrobial substances, regulatory responses to new plant-breeding techniques, and increasingly extreme climatic events. uncertainties also include evolving dietary preferences in light of health and sustainability issues and policy responses to alarming worldwide trends in obesity. population growth, urbanization and lifestylesworldwide, the use of cereals for food is projected to grow by about 150 million tonnes over the outlook period - amounting to a 13 percent increase - with rice and wheat accounting for the bulk of the expansion. the most significant factor behind the projected growth in food use of staple products is population growth, which is expected to rise fastest in sub-saharan africa and south asia. ""regrettably, the most needy regions are expected to see slow income growth and hence only small improvements in their nutritional status,"" warned fao assistant director-general for economic and social development máximo torero. ""the findings point to an overall decline in undernourishment; however, at current rates of improvement, we would remain far off track from reaching the zero hunger target by 2030.""""the outlook makes abundantly clear that trade is critical for global food security,"" said oecd director for trade and agriculture ken ash. ""regions that are experiencing rapid population growth are not necessarily those where food production can be increased sustainably, so it is essential that all governments support open, transparent and predictable agro-food markets.""the report finds that consumption levels of sugar and vegetable oil are projected to rise, reflecting the ongoing trend towards prepared and more processed foods, notably in many rapidly-urbanizing low and middle-income countries. concerns about health and wellbeing, meanwhile, are likely to nudge numerous higher-income countries towards lower consumption of red meat and a shift from vegetable oils to butter. in addition, the demand for feed crops is projected to outpace animal production growth in countries where the livestock sector is evolving from traditional to commercialised production systems, while the use of agricultural commodities as feedstock to produce biofuels is expected to grow primarily in the developing countries.   trade in agricultural and fisheries commodities should expand over the coming decade at around 1.3 percent annually, slower than over the past decade (3.3 percent average), as growth in global import demand is expected to slow. on the export side, both latin america and europe are projected to increase their sales to foreign markets. special focus on latin americathis year's publication features a special chapter on latin american and the caribbean, a region that accounts for 14 percent of global production and 23 percent of the world's exports of agricultural and fisheries products - a share expected to rise to 25 percent by 2028. despite the impressive growth, the region is facing persistent challenges in terms of food security, as many households are unable to afford the food they need. the region also faces growing natural resource challenges. ensuring a more sustainable and inclusive pathway for future agricultural growth will depend on developments in the areas of nutrition, social and environmental protection and support for livelihoods. there are ""strong growth opportunities"" in the region to produce high-value fruits and vegetables, which provide better opportunities for smallholders and healthier diets for the population. targeted policies could help farmers and consumers reap these opportunities, while protecting the region's natural resource base, the report notes.",2021-04-16

""the more people involved, the better it works,"" said graziano da silva. ""understanding the effects of climate change, planning the improvements in the efficiency of production and distribution of food, and monitoring progress towards the sustainable development goals require more frequent and precise data on the environment and its changes,"" he added.

""i am convinced that together we can eradicate hunger from our planet,"" diouf declared. ""but we must move from words to actions.""""let us do it for a more prosperous, more just, more equitable and more peaceful world. but above all, let us do it quickly because the poor and the hungry cannot wait,"" he added. the summit adopted five rome principles for sustainable global food security including: 1) invest in country-owned plans channeling resources to well-designed and results-based programmes and partnerships; 2) foster strategic coordination at all levels to improve governance, promote better allocation of resources and avoid duplication; 3) strive for a twin-track approach to food security including both short-term emergency and long-term development measures; 4) work to improve the efficiency, coordination and effectiveness of multilateral institutions; and 5) ensure sustained and substantial commitment by all partners to investment in agriculture and food security and nutrition. climate changethe summit also agreed to ""proactively face the challenges of climate change to food security and the need for adaptation of, and mitigation in agriculture... with particular attention to small agricultural producers and vulnerable populations.""in addition to member nations and representatives of international and regional organizations, who all addressed the plenary, meetings were held in the days preceding the summit to ensure that all voices were heard. a private-sector meeting was held on 12 and 13 november in milan, a parliamentary day was organized on 13 november in rome and a civil society forum took place in rome from 14 to 16 november. statements from all three events were read to the summit plenary.sixty heads of state and government and 191 ministers from 182 countries and the european community attended the summit. personalities included pope benedict xvi who said in his address the rules governing international trade should be separated from ""the logic of profit viewed as an end in itself"".",2021-04-16
"181","Hunger about more than food production, FAO Conference hears","","15 june 2013, rome - if the world wants to conquer hunger, it needs to tackle all the causes of hunger simultaneously particularly poverty, and not just concentrate on producing more food, amartya sen, nobel laureate in economics, told the opening session of the fao conference. delivering the mcdougall memorial lecture on food security, sen said:  ""the main factors behind the continuation of world hunger include the huge continuation of poverty, despite the increasing prosperity of the modern world in terms of averages and totals."" ""but poverty can be exacerbated by problems in the production side partly because of food supply falling behind food demand tends to raise food prices, which can make many families much poorer, given their incomes,"" sen said.   he pointed out that hunger and undernourishment are not uniform in a country, community, family or even among individuals within the same family. in analyzing causes of hunger, sen added, governments will need to take into account ""social norms and established conventions of sharing"" especially between men and women, boys and girls. sen won the nobel prize in 1998 for his groundbreaking theory that hunger and starvation result from some people not having access to enough food - what he called entitlement - not because there is not enough food available in the country or region. fao director-general josé graziano da silva said in his introductory remarks that amartya sen's approach has shifted the debate on hunger from food production to access to food and from charity to a rights-based approach and it has transformed the way we fight hunger and poverty today.african hunger in his lecture, sen said africa was not experiencing steadily rising per capita food availability, as asia is. in africa, per capita food production was only 4 per cent higher in 2011 compared with the average of 2004-6, and was 2 per cent lower in 2010.  ""hence it is right to attach importance to policy initiatives that raise food production in africa rather more robustly than has been happening,"" he said. sen urged africa countries to consider diversifying their economies, including through industrialization.  ""for the long-run economic stability and security of africa, economic diversification is quite crucial,"" he said. ""there is absolutely no reason to believe that unlike all other people across the world, africans somehow cannot industrialize successfully. to hold that view as a canon of faith comes close to, i fear, an odd kind of racism.""  overcoming military and civil strife, expanding democratic governance, and also developing market institutions, are further conditions that are needed to end hunger in africa.  the role of public policy must also cover the expansion of health care, family planning facilities, basic education, especially of women, and social security provisions,"" sen said. ""all these can contribute - directly and indirectly - to nutritional security, to good health care, and to a more successful overall economy, including a healthy agricultural sector.""   health care, education and hunger sen targeted maternal undernourishment, which he said not only ruined the health of the mothers but caused serious health problems for low-birth-weight children. ""to prevent persistent undernutrition attention has to be paid to health care, in general, and in particular to the prevention of endemic diseases that deter the absorption of nutrients,"" he said.   ""there is also plenty of evidence to indicate that lack of basic education too contributes to undernourishment, partly because knowledge and communication are important, but also because the ability to secure jobs and incomes are influenced by the level of education.""  summing up his speech, sen said that: ""these different influences, which operate together, demand that we do not isolate just one of those factors, and simply concentrate on that. we have to do many different things - together.""   frank lidgett mcdougall, an australian citizen, was one of the founders of fao. every two years, before the fao conference, the mcdougall lecture is delivered by a prominent personality working in the field of agriculture and hunger alleviation.",2021-04-16
"182","Promoting food systems transformation in the Mediterranean towards 2030","https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit","22 january 2021, rome - the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), the international centre for advanced mediterranean agronomic studies (ciheam) and the union for the mediterranean (ufm) have signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at accelerating progress on the 2030 agenda through food systems transformation in the mediterranean region. the agreement which was signed on 14 january marks a new step in collaboration between the three partners to jointly develop and adopt an innovative and science-based framework of actions to support the transition towards more sustainable food systems, while addressing the disruptions and fragilities caused by the covid-19 pandemic and contributing to build back better. the development of a multi-stakeholder platform (sfs-med platform) to leverage the existing knowledge, experience and skills of institutions across the mediterranean is also foreseen  capitalizing on their technical, scientific and political mandates, fao, ciheam and ufm will support the sfs-med platform to develop a 10-year transitional work plan that, through a substantial scientific base, will inform policy dialogue and transformative decision-making in the region, directly contributing to the preparatory process of the un food systems summit and, ultimately, to accelerating progress on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. the covid-19 pandemic has clearly shown that an urgent change of route is needed in the way we produce, process, distribute, consume and dispose of food worldwide. the three partners believe that such transformation needs to consider each specific context and will inevitably involve trade-offs for countries and stakeholders. sustainable, inclusive and resilient food systems are the key for better production and consumption, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life. the mediterranean region is no exception to this: population growth, demographic changes, urbanization and globalization are changing consumption and production patterns, in a context of climate change and decline of ecosystems. today, more than ever, the region is facing unprecedented and interdependent environmental, economic and social challenges that affect food security, health, nutrition, sustainability, and, thus, the livelihoods of all people across the mediterranean. the mou comes with a detailed work plan of concrete actions, to be jointly carried out between 2021 and 2024, that will span across several technical areas, such as sustainable management of land and water resources, sustainable fisheries, climate-smart and organic agriculture, food environments and healthy diets, sustainable value chain development, food loss and waste reduction, and expanding interdisciplinary collaboration in all aspects related to health care for humans, animals and the environment.",2021-04-16
"183","A major step forward in reducing food loss and waste is critical to achieve the SDGs","http://www.fao.org/3/ca6030en/ca6030en.pdf","14 october 2019, rome - a new fao report launched today by the un food and agriculture organization provides insights into how much food is lost - as well as where and why - at different stages of the food supply chain, calls for informed decisions for an effective reduction and offers new ways to measure progress.  this will not only help to achieve progress towards the important target of reducing food loss and waste, but could also contribute to a number of sustainable development goals related to food security and environmental sustainability, the report states.  according to the state of food and agriculture 2019, globally around 14 percent of the world's food is lost after harvesting and before reaching the retail level, including through on-farm activities, storage and transportation. however, the food losses vary considerably from one region to another within the same commodity groups and supply chain stages.  the report highlights the need, and offers a new methodology, to measure carefully losses at each stage in the food supply chain. doing so will help to identify critical loss points across the supply chain. these are points where food losses have the highest magnitude, the greatest impact on food security, and the largest economic dimensions, as well as to identify the appropriate measures for their reduction. it also points to the importance of reducing food waste, which occurs at the retail and consumption level and is linked to limited shelf life and consumer behaviour, such as   demanding food products that meet aesthetic standards, and limited incentive to avoid food waste. ""as we strive to make progress towards reducing food loss and waste, we can only be truly effective if our efforts are informed by a solid understanding of the problem,"" said fao director-general qu dongyu in the foreword to the report. he questioned, ""how we can allow food to be thrown away when more than 820 million people in the world continue to go hungry every day"". identifying critical loss points for targeted action  evidence presented in the report shows a vast range in terms of loss and waste percentages within commodities, supply chain stages and regions, suggesting there is a considerable potential for reduction where percentages are higher.  losses and waste are generally higher for fruits and vegetables than for cereals and pulses at all stages in the food supply chain, with the exception of on-farm losses and those during transportation in eastern and south-eastern asia.  in lower-income countries, more fresh fruit and vegetable loss is attributed to poor infrastructure than in industrialized countries. in fact, many lower-income countries lose significant amounts of food during storage, often due to poor storage facilities, including refrigerated warehouses.  despite the fact that that in most high-income countries adequate storage facilities, including refrigerated warehouses, are available throughout the supply chain, losses do occur during storage, generally because of a technical breakdown, poor management of temperature, humidity or overstocking.  the report also reveals the results from a number of case studies conducted by fao for identifying critical loss points. results indicate that harvesting is the most frequently identified critical loss point for all types of food. inadequate storage facilities and poor handling practices were also named among the main causes of on-farm storage losses. for fruits, roots and tubers, packaging and transportation also appear to be critical. such findings are valuable in providing guidance when identifying potential interventions for food loss reduction. getting the incentives right  the report urges countries to step up efforts to tackle the root causes of food loss and waste at all stages and provides guidance on policy and interventions to reduce food loss and waste. reducing food loss and waste generally entails costs, and farmers, suppliers and consumers will only take necessary measures if their costs are outweighed by the benefits. thus, changing incentives for various stakeholders in the supply chain will involve identifying options that either increase the net benefits or provide better information on the existing net benefits, the report states.  even when stakeholders are aware of the benefits of reducing food loss and waste, they  may face constraints that prevent them from implementing actions. for example, without financial help private actors in developing countries, especially smallholders, may not be able to bear the high upfront cost associated with implementing such actions. improving credit access could be an option even in the absence of detailed information on losses. the report will also help governments to analyse constraints and trade-offs for more efficient interventions.  for example, they can raise awareness of the benefits of reducing food loss and waste among suppliers and consumers and influence their decision-making through various types of actions or policies. however, the report stresses that the policy measures aimed at reducing food loss and waste should be coherent and involve effective monitoring and evaluation of interventions to assure accountability of existing actions and efforts.",2021-04-16

""this report shows that capture fisheries can be managed sustainably, while also pointing to the enormous and growing potential of aquaculture to boost human nutrition and support livelihoods with productive jobs.""aquaculturethat the global supply of fish for human consumption has outpaced population growth in the past five decades - preliminary estimates suggest per capita intakes higher than 20 kilograms, double the level of the 1960s - is due in large measure to growth in aquaculture. the sector's global production rose to 73.8 million tonnes in 2014, a third of which comprised molluscs, crustaceans and other non-fish animals. importantly in terms of both food security and environmental sustainability, about half of the world's aquaculture production of animals - often shellfish and carp - and plants - including seaweeds and microalgae - came from non-fed species. while china remains far the leading nation for aquaculture, it is expanding even faster elsewhere, the report notes. in nigeria, aquaculture output is up almost 20-fold over the past two decades, and all of sub-saharan africa is not far behind. chile and indonesia have also posted remarkable growth, as have norway and vietnam - now the world's no. 2 and no. 3 fish exporters. aquaculture's strengths and challenges are also influencing what fish end up on our plates. the report shows that, measured as a share of world trade in value terms, salmon and trout are now the largest single commodity, an honor that for decades belonged to shrimp. the state of sustainabilitysome 31.4 percent of the commercial wild fish stocks regularly monitored by fao were overfished in 2013, a level that has been stable since 2007.fao's methodology is consistent with international agreements  stating that fish stocks should be maintained at or rebuilt to a size that can support maximum sustainable yield (msy). thus, stocks are classified as being fished at biologically unsustainable levels - overfished - when they have an abundance lower than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. decreased fish landings have been observed in some regions due to the implementation of effective management regulations, like in the northwest atlantic, where the annual catch is now less than half the level of the early 1970s. halibut, flounder and haddock stocks in that area are showing signs of recovery, although that is not yet the case for cod.management measures also appear to be working for the highly-priced patagonian toothfish - a type of whitefish  from antarctica often marketed (in u.s. restaurants) as chilean sea bass - as the catch of that fish in antarctic waters has been stable since 2005. catches of antarctic krill, which feed directly on phytoplankton, jumped substantially to levels not reached since the early 1990s, while being maintained at sustainable levels.the report described the situation in the mediterranean and black sea - where 59% of assessed stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels - as ""alarming"". this is especially true for larger fish such as hake, mullet, sole and sea breams. in the eastern mediterranean, the possible expansion of invasive fish species associated to climate change is a concern.fao continues to work with all countries to improve the quality and reliability of annual landing figures. the doubling since 1996 of the number of species in the fao data base - now 2,033 - indicates overall quality improvements in the data collected, according to the report.supply-chain and other improvements have also raised the share of world fish production utilized for direct human consumption to 87 percent or 146 million tonnes in 2016, according to the report. that's up from 85 percent or 136 million tonnes in 2014. the growing fish-processing sector also offers opportunities to improve the sustainability of the fish supply chain, as a host of byproducts have multiple potential and actual uses, ranging from fishmeal for aquaculture, through collagen for the cosmetics industry to small fish bones humans can eat as snacks.",2021-04-16

achievement would not have been possible without the joint efforts and strong commitments of governments, the main organizations in africa, asia and europe, and without the continuous support of donors and international institutions"", fao director-general jacques diouf said today.diouf made the comment as fao's member countries officially recognized global freedom from the deadly cattle virus.the fao conference, the highest body of the un agency, adopted a resolution declaring global freedom from rinderpest. the resolution also called on the world community to follow up by ensuring that samples of rinderpest viruses and vaccines be kept under safe laboratory conditions and that rigorous standards for disease surveillance and reporting be applied.the declaration is the final step in a decades-long global campaign implemented by fao, in close coordination with the world organisation for animal health (oie), and other partners to eradicate rinderpest. this highly infectious disease has killed many millions of cattle, buffalo and other animals, and caused hunger and economic hardship, primarily in africa, asia and europe.the announcement followed verification last month by the world assembly of oie, that the disease was no longer circulating in its natural habitat. the last outbreak of rinderpest was registered in wild buffalo in kenya in 2001, and the last vaccination took place in 2006.""this successful eradication shows that actions against animal diseases do not come within concepts of agricultural or merchant good but within the concept of global public good because by alleviating poverty, contributing to public health and food security, and improving market access as well as animal welfare, they benefit all people and generations in the

cooperation and coordination mechanisms  funded by the european union, japan, ireland, italy, france, sweden, the united kingdom, the united states, the un development programme (undp) and others and supported by academic and research institutions across the world have been fundamental for the achievement of rinderpest eradication, particularly in the poorest countries.the programme's success had demonstrated the importance of political and financial support for veterinary services, community outreach, regional cooperation, and research.next stepsalthough the rinderpest virus no longer circulates amongst live animals, it is still kept in a number of laboratories. the immediate post-eradication priority is to guard against reappearance of the disease in animals as a result of accidental or deliberate release from laboratories.""rinderpest is the first animal disease to be eradicated by mankind and the second disease in general after smallpox. we must also focus our attention on measures to be taken to ensure that this result is sustainable and benefits future generations. to do this, a post-eradication strategy should be put in place to prevent any recurrence of the disease"", diouf said.fao, oie and their partners are determined to implement internationally agreed procedures for confining such virus stocks in highly bio-secure laboratory facilities.more about the diseaserinderpest is a highly contagious viral disease affecting several species of wild and domestic split-hoofed animals, notably cattle and buffalo. many species, including sheep and goats, can show milder clinical signs of the disease when infected, but the mortality rate can reach up to 100 per cent in highly susceptible cattle or buffalo herds. an outbreak of rinderpest in imported animals in belgium in 1920 was the impetus for international cooperation in controlling animal diseases, and a key factor leading to the establishment of the oie in 1924.other high-impact

""she taught me how to grow vegetables, how to prepare typical desserts and make limoncello, in the way it was done in her homeland. food and agriculture are values shared throughout this marvelous nation (italy). they were also the cornerstone of my academic formation, as i made my post-secondary studies in agronomic sciences,"" the fao director-general said.

""this drastic reduction in the number of undernourished people in a short time was possible due to strong political commitment by the government and the implementation of public policies aimed at combating extreme poverty and at consolidating a food security programme,"" graziano da silva said. ""at fao, we are proud to have been associated with this programme since its inception and to replicate its success outside brazil,"" graziano da silva said.",2021-04-16

"191","Using innovation to deliver in Somalia despite COVID-19","http://www.fsnau.org, http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/ca9192en","fao representative in somalia etienne peterschmitt discusses covid-19 and its impacts on vulnerable groups and the un agency's work.what is the situation like in somalia at present? somalia is a challenging place to operate even in a normal year. insecurity makes it difficult to reach people in rural areas where food security is extremely volatile. on top of the threat of coronavirus, many communities are also dealing with desert locusts and severe floods during somalia's gu main cropping season. coronavirus was first detected in the country in mid-march and since then somalia has recorded one of the highest caseloads in east africa. movement and trade restrictions triggered by the virus have not only impacted how we operate in somalia but they may also drive up the number of people in need of emergency food and livelihoods support.what are your concerns for the short- and mid-term in somalia?both lives and livelihoods are at risk from this pandemic, and i am particularly concerned about the impacts on vulnerable groups already grappling with hunger. somalia also currently faces its worst desert locust upsurge in decades and severe floods are affecting more than 900 000 people in both the north and south, including over 400 000 somalis who have been displaced.the fao-managed food security and nutrition analysis unit, or fsnau, has already warned earlier this month that the number of people facing crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity is expected to triple between july and september to 3.5 million compared to the start of the year. that's more than a quarter of the country's population requiring urgent humanitarian assistance. it's over 100 percent greater than hunger figures in an average year, and the highest level of humanitarian need in somalia since july 2017, when the country was at the the height of a severe drought.remittances sent by relatives working abroad are a lifeline for many people in the country. they also support  part of the urban economy in somalia, creating jobs and income. but as the somalia diaspora in other countries lose their jobs because of the virus, remittance flows to somalia are decreasing sharply and many somalis may find it extremely difficult to make ends meet. fsnau is estimating that there will be a 30 to 50 percent decline in these remittance flows.we're also expecting that measures taken to curb the spread of covid-19 in somalia will likely cause a 20 to 30 percent decline in income among poor urban households and internally displaced people, and a 20 to 50 percent increase in imported food prices. at the same time, livestock exports are expected to decline 30 to 50 percent due to covid-19 and other factors.the virus is also spreading at a crucial time for farmers, as the gu planting season is underway. we are working hard to ensure farmers can access seeds and other inputs to plant this season so that they can have a source of food and income at harvest time.fao has launched a humanitarian appeal to fund our response globally to the covid-19 crisis. in somalia, the funding would mean we can maintain the provision of critical assistance where needs were already high, while meeting new needs as they emerge.in what ways has coronavirus impacted fao's operations in somalia?our mobile payment procedures, for example, have had to swiftly adapt to the new operating environment, both to accommodate movement restrictions and contribute to the effort to prevent the spread of the virus. mobile money is a platform we developed over the last two years, with support from usaid. it allows money to be delivered by mobile phone to beneficiaries once they are registered and verified. it replaces in-person transfers where people would collect money from a money trader.under mobile money, trained agents meet beneficiaries to record their details and register their fingerprints through an app developed in-house by fao called bimo. as covid-19 spreads, we removed the biometric requirement and substituted it with gps-enabled photos, taken at the time of beneficiary registration and verification, before the cash entitlements are disbursed. we are also working on incorporating voice and facial recognition apps.it's an innovative and safer way to support the most vulnerable people in rural areas, and it means we are able to serve people in some of the country's most remote and insecure regions, and with no disruptions caused by the virus.how many people have received cash support in this way so far?since mid-march when the covid-19 emergency started in somalia, fao has transferred $4 million to 200,000 people safely through the mobile money program. by june, an additional 180,000 people will be registered to receive the life-saving cash support.in total there are over 350,000 households, comprising more than 2.1 million people, registered in fao's mobile money platform in somalia, which means we can quickly scale up to reach those in need as the current crisis develops.we are doing more than cash disbursement though. for the ongoing main cropping season, we are also sending electronic vouchers by phone text message to around 40,000 farming households. the vouchers are for local quality seeds, farm tools, irrigation services and storage bags among other cropping essentials, redeemed from a network of local, approved traders. these traders are equipped with dedicated tablets to properly identify the voucher through its unique transaction code, take gps-enabled photos and verify the beneficiaries.by sourcing the inputs locally, we are reinjecting money into the local economy and avoiding supply chain delays due to covid-19. and removing all the paperwork has also made our operation faster, more efficient and safer during this pandemic.",2021-04-16
"192","UN food agencies warn of rising levels of acute hunger with potential risk of famine in four hotspots","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb1907en, http://www.ipcinfo.org/, http://www.fightfoodcrises.net/","joint fao-wfp news release 6 november 2020, rome - the world has been put on a heightened famine alert with a new report by two united nations agencies that contains a stark warning; four countries contain areas that could soon slip into famine if conditions there undergo ""any further deterioration over the coming months"". these are burkina faso in west africa's sahel region, northeastern nigeria, south sudan and yemen.  the early warning analysis of acute food insecurity hotspots - issued today by the food and agriculture organization of the un (fao) and the un world food programme (wfp) - describes a toxic combination of conflict, economic decline, climate extremes and the covid-19 pandemic that is driving people further into the emergency phase of food insecurity. parts of the population in the four hotspots of highest concern are already experiencing a critical hunger situation, with the report warning that escalations in conflict as well as a further reduction in humanitarian access could lead to a risk of famine. but these four countries are far from being the only red flag on a world map that shows that acute food insecurity levels are reaching new highs globally, driven by a combination of factors, the report notes. another 16 countries are at high risk of rising levels of acute hunger.  the aim of the hotspots report is to inform urgent action that can be taken now to avoid a major emergency - or series of emergencies - in three to six months from today. how the situation evolves in the highest risk countries will depend on conflict dynamics, food prices, and the myriad impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on their food systems, rainfall and harvest outcomes, humanitarian access, and the readiness of donors to continue funding humanitarian operations.  ""this report is a clear call to urgent action,"" said dominique burgeon, fao's director of emergencies and resilience. ""we are deeply concerned about the combined impact of several crises which are eroding people's ability to produce and access food, leaving them more and more at risk of the most extreme hunger. we need access to these populations to ensure they have food and the means to produce food and improve their livelihoods to prevent a worst-case scenario.""  ""we are at a catastrophic turning point. once again, we face the risk of famine in four different parts of the world at the same time. when we declare a famine it means many lives have already been lost. if we wait to find that out for sure, people are already dead,"" said margot van der velden, wfp director of emergencies.  ""in 2011, somalia suffered a famine that killed 260 ,000 people. the famine was declared in july, but most people had already died by may. we cannot let this happen again. we have a stark choice; urgent action today, or unconscionable loss of life tomorrow,"" she warned.  negative trends across the board all told, the joint report points to a total of 20 countries and contexts that are at ""further risk of deterioration of acute food insecurity"", with key drivers of hunger including expansion and intensification of violence, economic crises exacerbated by covid-19 socioeconomic impact, weather extremes, transboundary threats like the desert locust and a lack of humanitarian access. it notes that in the democratic republic of the congo there are 22 million people now estimated to be acutely food insecure - the highest number ever registered for a single country. burkina faso has registered the biggest increase with the numbers of desperately hungry people almost tripling compared to 2019, driven by increasing conflict, displacement and covid-related impacts on employment and food access. the situation is also dire in yemen, where the existing food insecurity combined with conflict and a deepening economic crisis could lead to a further deterioration of an already critical food security situation. catastrophe/famine is the most severe of five phases used by the integrated phase classification (ipc) system to chart escalating degrees of food insecurity. when this extreme phase is declared, it means that people have already started dying from starvation. the hotspots report is saying that, unless urgent action is now taken, the world could experience its first outbreak of famine since it was last declared in 2017 in parts of south sudan. this new report was developed under the global network against food crises (gnafc) - an alliance of humanitarian and development actors launched in 2016 by the european union, fao and wfp to tackle the root causes of food crises through shared analysis and knowledge, strengthened coordination in evidence-based responses, and collective efforts across the humanitarian, development and peace nexus. fao note: the alerts concerning burkina faso and nigeria that today's report drew on were issued in early november and based on information available during october. new analyses are being carried out in these countries using the cadre harmonisé (ch) methodology. ch results for northeast nigeria released on 5 november indicate a reduced risk of famine, but also signalled that a concerted effort is needed to avoid families falling back into emergency levels of food insecurity.  in south sudan, an ipc analysis is currently underway and the results will be released in the coming weeks. these new assessments will provide further clarity on the actual situation and evidence to inform how countries and humanitarian actors respond.",2021-04-16
"193","Deadly cattle plague, once the bane of farmers, on its deathbed","","30 november 2009, rome - in animal health circles, it's the equivalent of the apollo 11 moon landing: some time in the next 18 months, fao jointly with the world organisation for animal health (oie) and other partners will officially declare one of the most devastating animal diseases known to man, rinderpest, as eradicated.it will be the first time in history that humankind has succeeded in killing off an animal disease and only the second time a disease has been consigned to the dustbin as a result of human efforts. (the first was smallpox, in 1980.)the victory comes after an intense decades-long campaignspearheaded by fao and involving a broad alliance of partnersto isolate rinderpest, also known as cattle plague, in its last few remaining pockets and then wipe it out, once and for all.an ancient enemyrinderpest does not affect humans directly but it is lethal to the cattle and hoofed animals upon which they depend for food, income, and draught power. death rates during outbreaks can approach 100%.caused by a virus and spread by contact and contaminated materials, rinderpest has destroyed countless millions of cattle, buffalo, yaks and their wild relatives, causing staggering economic losses and contributing to famine and social unrest for thousands of years.carried into europe from asia by invading tribes, outbreaks of rinderpest hit the roman empire in ad 376-386 and are suspected as having played a role in its decline and collapse.recurring epidemics in france during the 1700s provoked famine and drops in agricultural productivity, feeding into the unrest that culminated in the revolution of 1789.when rinderpest was introduced into sub-saharan africa at the end of the 19th century it killed off 80 to 90 percent of all cattle in the region, leaving the livelihoods of farmers and pastoralists in tatters, causing widespread famine and rendering the region weak in the face of european colonization.at its height in the 1920s, the rinderpest footprint extended from scandinavia to the cape of good hope and from the atlantic shore of africa to the philippine archipelago, with one outbreak reported in brazil and another in australia.in the early 1980s, the disease was still ravaging livestock herds around the world, with devastating epidemics hitting south asia, the middle east and africa. losses in nigeria in the 1980s totalled $2 billion. a 1994 outbreak in northern pakistan wiped out more than 50 000 cattle and buffalo before being brought under control with help from fao.how fao helped turn things aroundalthough some countries made progress during the 20th century in dealing with rinderpest on their own territory, it continued to survive and thrive in others, forming reservoirs from which it regularly broke out.using a newly developed vaccine, after 1960 efforts were made to combat rinderpest on a broader scale through various regional campaigns. while successful at first, these programs usually were discontinued too soon and allowed the disease make dramatic comebacks. like highly pathogenic avian influenza of the h5n1 variety or the pandemic h1n1/2009 flu virus today, rinderpest seemed unstoppable.starting in the late 1980s, the fao began to convene a series of regular meetings involving animal health authorities from around the globe as well key international organizations like oie and the african union's inter-african bureau for animal resources. the science needed to deal with rinderpest was there. past successes at the regional level showed that it could be combated effectively. what would it take to do away with the disease, once and for all, fao asked?the answer that came out of the talks: a high-level umbrella program that would weave together national and regional activities into a concerted world-wide campaign against the disease. fao, participants agreed, was the institution best-suited to oversee such a network.and so in 1994 the global rinderpest eradication programme was launched, after a series of consultations to gather recommendations from experts around the world. the grep was set up to act as a spider at the centre of a weba global coordination mechanism that would allow the international community to jointly undertake rinderpest control in a systematic and comprehensive way.with fao acting as the coordinating secretariat and involving a large group of partner governments, agencies and organizations, the grep initially focused on charting out the true geographical distribution of rinderpest, getting a better understanding of rinderpest's epidemiology, and helping countries cope with emergency situations.phase two involved targeted action at the local level where the virus was in circulation.fao channelled vast amounts of technical assistance to countries to help them first extinguish outbreaks and then put in place the systems and measures needed to stay free of it.activities ran the gamut. teaching farmers how to recognize and report the disease. establishing emergency response plans, biosecurity protocols, and national programs for monitoring and control. training veterinarians on designing and implementing blood survey campaigns followed by clinical surveillance and setting up laboratories. (see text at right)the joint fao/iaea division in vienna worked to develop and then transfer new rinderpest diagnostic technology to developing countries. grep, oie and fao/iaea developed performance indicators to assess the campaign's progress.in the face of this cohesive effort, slowly but surely rinderpest began to retreat (see graphic).now grep's focus became assisting countries in undertaking the painstaking work of establishing that the rinderpest pathogen was fully eradicated in their animal populations in order to earn a disease-free status from oie, the international certification body for animal diseases. between 1994 and 2009, around 170 countries and territories succeeded in eliminating rinderpest and acquired oie certification thanks to grep support by early 2000, the rinderpest virus was contained to parts of the somali ecosystem (ses), an area covering southern somalia and adjoining parts of ethiopia and kenya, where its footprint could still be found in the bloodstreams of certain animal populations. the last-ever outbreak of the disease occurred in kenya, in 2001.today the last reservoir appears to have been cleared; setting the stage for a full global certification of rinderpest eradication. fao is committed to seeing the last control activities completed next year in partnership with oie and all concerned stakeholders. major gains in food production and incomefao estimates that additional production due to rinderpest's eradication in india alone from 1965 to 1998 added up to $289 billion. the benefits in africa have been estimated at around $1 billion per year during the same period. billions of dollars have no doubt also been generated in other countries, such as sri lanka, pakistan, afghanistan, iran, iraq and turkey. ""most importantly, the protection of cattle in sub-saharan africa, the near east and asia has improved both food and income streams for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pastoral people and small farmers and helped avoid famine and the loss of draught power in agricultural communities,"" says felix njeumi of the grep secretariat at fao.there has been a gain for the conservation of biodiversity, as well, as species that may be endangered will now have one less problem to face.imagining the impossible""when you think about it, it's quite remarkable that we are where we are today,"" says juan lubroth, fao's chief veterinary officer. ""this is a disease that has been an absolute scourge in agriculture for millennia.""""but if you look at it another way, the solution was simple. we had the know-how. we had the vaccine. what was missing was, in the first place, adequate and targeted investment, and, secondly, a cohesive global coordinating mechanism. once we had those, solving the problem was just a matter of time. the very substantial investments of many development partners in this programme, first among them the european commission, and the strong commitment of national governments and of mandated regional organizations have been instrumental in this success story,"" he adds.",2021-04-16
"194","Joint Statement on COVID-19 Impacts on Food Security and Nutrition","","21 april 2020, rome/washington dc -  on the occasion of today's extraordinary g20 agriculture minister's meeting, the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), the international fund for agricultural development (ifad), the world bank and the world food programme (wfp) have issued the following joint statement on covid-19 impacts on food security and nutrition: ""the covid-19 pandemic has led to dramatic loss of human life across the world and presents an unprecedented challenge with deep social and economic consequences, including compromising food security and nutrition. responses need to be well coordinated across the world, including by the g20 and beyond, to limit impacts, end the pandemic, and prevent its recurrence.  the pandemic is already affecting the entire food system. restrictions on movement within and across countries can hinder food-related logistic services, disrupt entire food supply chains and affect the availability of food. impacts on the movement of agricultural labor and on the supply of inputs will soon pose critical challenges to food production, thus jeopardizing food security for all people, and hit especially hard people living in the poorest countries.  agriculture and its food-related logistic services should be considered as essential. increased efforts are needed to ensure that food value chains function well and promote the production and availability of diversified, safe and nutritious food for all. in doing this, it is necessary to give precedence to the health of consumers and workers, adhering to safety measures, such as testing, physical distancing and other hygienic practices. currently, the world food market is well supplied and all countries, particularly those with prominent trade shares, need to ensure that it remains a stable, transparent and reliable source of food. during the 2007-08 food price crisis, panic-driven policy responses, such as export bans and rapid escalation in food stock procurement through imports exacerbated market disruptions.  while food supplies were tighter because of weather shocks globally in 2007-08, this behavior stretches the balance between global food supply and demand, increasing price volatility and ultimately contributing to it. these immediate impacts proved extremely damaging for low-income food-import dependent countries, and to the efforts of humanitarian organizations to procure supplies.  countries need to work together to strengthen cooperation during this pandemic that is affecting all regions of the world. it is important to ensure that policies, such as short-term measures to restrict trade, do not distort global markets.  collective action is needed to ensure that markets are well-functioning, and that timely and reliable information on market fundamentals is available to all. this will reduce uncertainty and allow producers, consumers, traders and processors to make informed production and trade decisions and contain panic behavior in global markets.  the agricultural market information system - a g20 initiative that combines the expertise of ten international organizations with the information provided by countries with a high share in world food trade - is monitoring world supply and price developments. the devastating economic impacts of covid-19 reinforce the need for investments that prevent future outbreaks of such infectious diseases, recognizing the interconnections between people, animals, plants and their shared environment - the one health approach. continued attention is necessary strengthen the resilience of food systems to such disease outbreaks but also to other shocks. as the pandemic slows down economies, access to food will be negatively affected by income reductions and loss of employment as well as availability of food in local markets. efforts should focus on supporting access to food for the poor and the vulnerable and those whose income is most affected. implementing adequate social protection measures, such as cash transfers, and investing in early recovery efforts in response to covid-19 is critical to saving both lives and livelihoods. ensuring that these measures reach everyone will be key to avoid further spread of poverty and hunger.  countries with existing humanitarian crises are particularly exposed to the effects of the pandemic. its effects could be even stronger in those countries that are already facing exceptional emergencies with direct consequences for agriculture including due to ongoing or emerging conflict and climate shocks or desert locust outbreaks.  the pandemic is likely to have significant repercussions on the delivery of humanitarian and recovery assistance. maintaining ongoing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable groups and adapting to potential covid-19 impacts is critical. investment is needed to accelerate recovery efforts and build resilience of vulnerable populations, coordinating our efforts with all partners including with the un framework for the immediate socio-economic response to covid-19.  decisive collective action is needed now to ensure that this pandemic does not threaten food security and nutrition, and to improve resilience to future shocks.  on this, we highlight the 2021 food systems summit as an opportunity to drive transformative action and contribute to the un decade of action to deliver the sdgs by 2030.""",2021-04-16

""these factors, which can be encountered in all fisheries across the world, are largely responsible for the lack of success, rather than any inherent unmanageable qualities of shrimp fishing gear or practices."" the report urges countries to make agencies more effective and provide legislation to support rights-based and dedicated access-systems.the upcoming edition of fao's biennial report the state of world fisheries and aquaculture, set to be released on 2 march 2009, contains a special chapter that looks at shrimp fisheries.",2021-04-16

""it is encouraging to see that net deforestation is decreasing and that some countries in all regions are showing impressive progress. among others, they include brazil, chile, china, cape verde, costa rica, philippines, republic of korea, turkey, uruguay, and viet nam,"" said fao director-general jose graziano da silva. ""i urge all those countries to share their successful experiences with other countries. through south-south cooperation programme, fao is ready to facilitate this collaboration and knowledge exchange.""  fao emphasized at the same time that despite the overall reduction in carbon emissions from forests linked to less deforestation, emissions from forest degradation have significantly increased between 1990 and 2015, from 0.4 to 1.0 gt co2 per year. forest degradation is a reduction in tree biomass density from human or natural causes such as logging, fire, windthrows and other events. fao published these figures for the first time on the occasion of the international day of forests, celebrated on 21 march 2015. the data are excerpts from a larger fao study based on the faostat emissions database and fao's global forest resources assessment 2015 (fra), which will be launched in september 2015 as one of the highlights of the xiv world forestry congress in durban. this will be the first time this global event is organized in africa, under the auspices of the government of south africa, with more than 5,000 participants expected. managing forests sustainably to address the impacts of climate change a more sustainable management of forests will result in a reduction in carbon emissions from forests and has a vital role to play in addressing the impacts of climate change, the fao director-general stressed.   ""forests are critical to the earth's carbon balance and hold about three-quarters as much carbon as is in the whole atmosphere. deforestation and forest degradation increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but forest and tree growth absorbs carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas emissions"", he said.  graziano da silva also highlighted the important role of sustainable agriculture to reduce pressure on forests, along with implementing the un-redd programme to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.  imbalances between countries and regions the absorption of carbon by forests helps to counterbalance, although not entirely, overall emissions due to the conversion of forests to other types of land use. forests absorb and store an additional two billion tonnes of co2   per year (2011-2015), excluding emissions from deforestation. half of the forest carbon sink is related to growth in planted forests.   developed countries continue to represent the bulk of the overall estimated carbon sink, with a share of 60 percent (2011-2015). this share, however, has decreased from 65 percent (2001-2010), mainly due to a decrease in the establishment of new planted forests.    developing countries account for the remaining 40 percent of the total carbon sink.   at the regional level, africa, asia and latin america and the caribbean all continued to release more carbon than they absorb, although emissions from africa and latin america decreased between 1990 and 2015. brazil alone represented more than 50 percent of the overall estimated reduction in carbon emissions between 2001and 2015. the forests of europe and north america functioned as net carbon sinks between 1990 and 2015 since they absorb more carbon than they release, whereas oceania did not show a clear trend in forest emissions over the same period. methodology   the fao analysis is based on national data reported to the agency by countries using ground-based and aerial measurements. they are not directly comparable to measurements using satellite imagery only, which, although useful, do not capture certain types of forests or stages in the growth cycle, and do not easily capture land-use change dynamics.  for example, dry forests in africa or central brazil have great spaces between trees and often have few leaves for large parts of the year, making them difficult to capture by remote sensing, and regular harvesting activities in managed forests may be detected as deforestation by satellite surveys.",2021-04-16

"200","FAO calls for action to accelerate economic transformation and development in Africa","","24 march 2014, tunis - despite important economic progress and agricultural successes, africa remains the worlds most food insecure continent, with relatively low levels of agricultural productivity, low rural incomes, and high rates of malnutrition, fao said today.as the organizations 28th regional conference for africa gathers in tunis, fao is calling on african ministers of agriculture for action in priority areas to accelerate increased investment and broad-based transformation in support of smallholder farmers, including rural youth and women.  africa has recorded continuous economic growth since 1999, accompanied by improved governance and human development indicators. currently, seven out of the top ten fastest growing economies in the world are situated in africa, and the international monetary fund estimates that economic growth in sub-saharan africa will be 6.1 percent in 2014.africas annual total gdp grew on average by 4.8 percent in 2000-2010, up from 2.1 percent in the previous decade, and the agricultural sectors growth rates in the same time period were 3.2 percent and 3.0 percent respectively.the continent has achieved a series of agricultural successes in major areas, including the intensification of staple food production, improved varieties of banana in eastern and central africa, high-yielding varieties of maize in east and southern africa, and productivity gains in cotton production in burkina faso and mali and in tea and floriculture in east africa.the question is how african leaders can build on this progress by providing stable agriculture and fiscal policies that encourage investment, as committed 10 years ago in the maputo declaration, and strengthen governance and accountability mechanisms that contribute to more systemic implementation of policies and programmes, said bukar tijani, fao assistant director-general and regional representative for africa.these actions are critical to trigger a transformation in the capacity of countries to deliver sustained and broad-based agricultural growth and development.the conference will advocate for providing the enabling environment to end hunger in the continent by 2025. it will primarily focus on sustainably increasing the potential of agriculture, fisheries, livestock and forestry as a source of employment and income for african youth, women and men who engage in these sectors for food and nutrition security as well as agri-business ventures aimed at increasing family incomes. the status and trends of agriculture, food and nutrition in africatrends in per capita food production have been generally positive over recent decades. on average, agricultural production in africa has increased slightly less than 1 percent per year, compared with about 2 percent in developing countries. while africa experienced high instability in food price levels, per capita food production was more stable over time and variability was relatively low compared to other regions, such as asia or latin america.but despite the overall progress made on hunger and malnutrition in africa over the past decades, absolute levels of hunger and undernourishment remain worrying in sub-saharan africa, fao said. fao estimates that poverty rates in africa declined marginally from 56 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 2010, leaving 388 million in extreme poverty and approximately 239 million chronically undernourished in the continent.  the food security situation in the sahel and the horn of africa continues to be of particular concern.by 2012, africa as a continent had made the least progress in reducing poverty. the 2012 united nations millennium development goals (mdg) report states that africa is 41 percent off the first mdg poverty target versus 25 percent in south asia and 6.1 percent in latin america. however, 11 african countries have already met the first mdg hunger target to reduce by half the proportion of hungry people between 1990 and 2015 (see box right). three countries - djibouti, ghana, and são tomé and príncipe - have also met the even more ambitious 1996 world food summit goal to reduce by half the total number of hungry.enabling environment for investmentin order to compete successfully with imports in their own growing domestic and regional agribusiness markets, african farmers and agribusinesses will need to improve value chain efficiency at all levels, fao said.the organization underscored that there are significant opportunities for accelerating smallholder-driven agriculture and agri-business in africa as the basis for transforming and commercializing the sector.due to rapid urbanization, around 40 percent of africas population is now living in urban areas and consuming approximately 50 percent of the total food, boosting the importance of rural-urban food supply chains.policy-makers should see this urban market as at least as much of an opportunity as the export market, particularly since it is more accessible to small family farms and firms, the organization stressed.numerous and interesting examples of the dynamic growth of rural-urban supply chains and agri-food systems can be found throughout the continent including: millers-cum-retailers of teff in addis ababa markets; the millet supply chain in senegal with the rise in branded, packaged millet and millet-cum-dairy products for the dakar market and for export; the chicken supply chain in urban nigeria, mozambique and many other african countries, giving rise to a wide range of local and regional poultry companies; and the rapid rise of dairy processing companies, linked to small farmers, in kenya and zambia. concerted efforts are needed to assist a broader set of asset-poor family farms gain access to agricultural inputs, affordable credit, rural services and extension information that allows them to take advantage of the growing market. innovative social protection and risk management programmes are also required to address the particular constraints of smallholder farmers, fao said.sustaining caadp momentumwith a view to enhancing fao contributions to the implementation of the comprehensive africa agriculture development programme (caadp) at country, regional and continental levels, the organization undertook important activities in 2013 towards strengthening and aligning capacity on caadp activities for 2014 and 2015. in july 2013, fao collaborated with the african union commission and lula institute to host a high-level meeting in addis ababa, ethiopia, toward african renaissance: renewed partnership for unified approach to end hunger in africa by 2025 within the caadp framework. the declaration of the high-level meeting  which was also endorsed at the january 2014 african union summit - urges african heads of state to end hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition on the continent by 2025. the high-level meeting roadmap recommends joint actions to mainstream and operationalize the partnership for a renewed unified approach to end hunger in africa through caadp, implemented primarily with its own resources and with the assistance of technical and development partners.the africa solidarity trust fund for food security was meanwhile officially launched during the 38th session of the fao conference in june 2013. the fund currently has $40 million, to initially support projects in central african republic, ethiopia, malawi, mali and niger. the major contributions so far come from equatorial guinea and angola. the fund is one of the few africa-led innovative mechanisms of mobilizing resources from africa for africa.faos regional conference for africa is taking place from 24-28 march in the tunisian capital. in total, 54 african member countries will participate in the conference, 30 of which will be represented at ministerial level. in addtion, austria, china, the dominican republic, france, italy, india, the netherlands, spain, sweden, switzerland, the united kingdom and the united states of america as well as the holy see will attend as observers.",2021-04-16
"201","Fisheries: Urgent action needed on overfishing, pollution and climate change","http://www.fao.org/cofi/en/","9 june 2014, rome - fao director-general josé graziano da silva opened a meeting of the world's only inter-governmental forum on fisheries and aquaculture issues, calling for urgent action to address climate change and other threats to sustainable fisheries and fish stocks. fao's committee on fisheries (cofi) opened its 9-13 june session to address a range of issues related to the long-term well-being of marine and inland fisheries and aquaculture and to discuss potential action by governments, regional fishery bodies, ngos, fish workers and other actors in the international community. saying that fisheries and aquaculture make a ""central contribution to food security and nutrition,"" graziano da silva added that sustainable development in the world's island and coastal states was especially dependent on the ""vitality of oceans and fish stocks."" ""overfishing, pollution and climate change are putting this vitality at risk. the impacts are already evident. and the world's poor, in rural and coastal areas, are among the most affected,"" said graziano da silva. ""i want to stress the urgency of individual and collective action to address climate change, one of the most pressing challenges the world faces today,"" he said, adding that fao was making it a priority in its work to improve sustainable development through its blue growth initiative. the director-general pointed out that fisheries and aquaculture were the sources of 17 percent of the animal protein consumed in the world and up to 50 percent in some small island developing states (sids) and asian countries. they were also central to the livelihoods of some of the most vulnerable families in the world. ""the livelihoods of 12 percent of the world's population depend on this sector. in particular, small-scale fisheries are the source of employment for more than 90 percent of the world's capture fishers and fish workers, about half of whom are women,"" he said. ""at the same time that small-scale fishers supply most of the fish consumed in the developing world, many of their families are food-insecure themselves. this is a paradox that we are working together to overcome,"" he said, stressing that small-scale fishers were an integral part of efforts to improve sustainability and food security. international forum  the director-general joined johan williams, chairperson of cofi's 31st session, in welcoming ministers in charge of fisheries or agriculture and rural development from algeria, bangladesh, brazil, the republic of guinea, indonesia, mali and sri lanka. participants also included vice-ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers from azerbaijan, ghana, guatemala, honduras, the islamic republic of iran, the maldives, namibia, peru, saudi arabia and yemen. among other issues, participants were to consider endorsement of two key sets of voluntary guidelines designed to improve sustainability and responsible fisheries conduct, respectively: the voluntary guidelines for securing sustainable small-scale fisheries and the voluntary guidelines for flag state performance.",2021-04-16
"202","New software keys in on fins to save sharks","http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/277824/icode/","19 february 2015, rome-sharks may be able to swim more serenely one day thanks to a handy new digital technique developed by fao that allows for the quick identification of species of the iconic fish. the new isharkfin software will help protect endangered shark species and combat illegal trade in shark fins. it is a tool for custom officers and inspectors at fish markets as well as for fishermen keen on avoiding the capture of protected species, said monica barone, who led a team in fao's fisheries and aquaculture department in the development of the software. work on the project began in 2013, after five shark species were added to the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites). how isharkfin worksthe system is based on machine learning techniques and provides expertise to port inspectors, custom agents, market inspectors and fish traders who lack formal taxonomic training. a photograph is uploaded, the user then chooses a few key points of the fin shape along with identifying a few other characteristics, and an algorithm compares the information with its memory bank and identifies the shark specie. the process takes about five minutes. fao is developing an app version of isharkfin that can be used with tablets or smart phones, broadening its potential reach and use.so far the isharkfin can identify 35 shark species from dorsal fins - the iconic one atop the animal's spine - and seven from just the pectoral fins underneath.  many of the types are those most frequently traded internationally. more will be added, but as some species are becoming quite rare, it takes time to gather an adequately complete data.the software was developed by fao in collaboration with the university of vigo in spain. cites and the government of japan provided financial support.  shark survivalintroducing isharkfin will allow authorities to identify precisely what is the species from which the fins were removed. with isharkfin the data on photographed fins can be used to extrapolate the presumed volume and weight of the whole animal, leading to a back-door calculation of aggregate shark harvesting, said barone. consequently, it will also help to produce better official statistics on shark catches which may be underestimated when the whole animal is not landed due to ""shark finning,"" a practice involving slashing off a shark's fins and dumping the animal back into the sea. many nations have declared shark finning illegal and insist that shark fins may be traded only if the whole carcass is brought to shore aiming at protecting a group of animals that take a long time to mature and produce few offspring. the challenges of effective management in high seas areas, including responsible fishing and conservation of species at risk, are being discussed this week at a high-level workshop at fao. learn more.",2021-04-16

standards body codex alimentarius commission is meeting in geneva this week to examine food safety and quality standards. charged with protecting consumer health and ensuring fair practices in the food trade, the codex alimentarius is a joint initiative of the food and agriculture organization (fao) and the world health organization (who). decisions taken at the 37th session of the commission will be published below.---------------------------maximum residue levels for pesticidesagreed pesticides are chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and other pests to prevent them from damaging crops. even when used according to best practices, low levels of residues of pesticides can end up in food. in order to ensure that such residues do not cause harm to people's health and based on risk assessments provided by a group of independent international experts (joint fao/who expert meeting on pesticide residues, jmpr), the codex alimentarius commission recommends maximum residue limits for the amount of a pesticide in a specific food, e.g. a limit of 0.02 mg/kg of bananas or coffee beans for the weed killer diquat, or a limit of 0.6 mg/kg in plums for propiconazole used to prevent mould growth.report of the last meeting of the codex committee on pesticide residues more information about jmprpest and pesticide management maximum levels for fumonisins in maize and maize productsagreed fumonisins are toxins produced by moulds growing on maize both in the field and after harvesting. humidity, inadequate storage and insect damage can all increase the risk of fumonisin-producing moulds. the toxins have been reported in maize crops worldwide and have a negative effect on human and animal health. the codex alimentarius commission has set maximum levels for the presence of fumonisins at 4 mg/kg in raw maize grain and 2 mg /kg in maize flour and maize meal.report of the last meeting of the codex committee on contaminants in foodswhat are mycotoxins? maximum levels for inorganic arsenic in polished rice agreed arsenic is a naturally occurring element in the earth's crust. it is present in many foods due to absorption from the soil and water. rice in particular can take up more arsenic than other foods and due to its high consumption can contribute significantly to arsenic exposure. long-term exposure to arsenic from drinking-water and food can cause cancer and skin lesions. it has also been associated with developmental effects, heart disease, diabetes, and damage the nervous system and brain. to protect consumers from excessive exposure, the codex alimentarius commission recommends that the level of arsenic in rice should not exceed 0.2 mg/kg.report of the last meeting of the codex committee on contaminants in food arsenic fact sheetremediation of arsenic for agriculture sustainability, food security and health in bangladesharsenic threat in ricemaximum levels for lead in infant formulaagreedlead is a chemical that exists in the environmentin the air, water, plants, etc. if humans consume too much lead it is detrimental to their health. infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead. they can suffer profound and permanent adverse health effects, particularly affecting the development of the brain and nervous system, which can diminish their ability to learn. infant formula contaminated with lead represents a particular risk because of the volume that infants consume. levels of lead in infant formula can be controlled by sourcing raw materials from areas where lead is less present. the codex alimentarius commission recommends that no more than 0.01 mg per kg should be permitted in infant formula as consumed.report of the last meeting of the codex committee on contaminants in food lead fact sheet maximum levels for food additivesagreed additives are substances added to food or animal feed for a technological function, such as preservatives to keep food fresh for longer, antioxidants to stop food from becoming rancid and stabilisers to help mix ingredients. additives also comprise colours, flavours and sweeteners. the safety of food additives is evaluated by an independent international expert committee (joint fao/who expert committee on food additives, jecfa) before their use in food can be recommended. based on jecfa's safety assessments, the codex alimentarius commission recommended a large number of maximum use levels of specific food additives in various foods, such as fresh pasta, frozen or smoked fish, frozen or fermented vegetables, and powdered infant formula, to assure consumers' health.report of the last meeting of the codex committee on food additives food additive indexmore information about jecfastandards for passion fruit, durian and okraagreed the codex alimentarius commission has adopted new quality standards for passion fruit, durian and okra to ensure they reach the consumer in an acceptable condition after preparation and packaging, which includes being clean, free from pests or damage from heat or cold, and with an appropriate degree of development or ripeness. the standards also set out minimum weights permitted for sizing purposes as well as recommendations on labeling.report of the last meeting of the codex committee on fresh fruits and vegetablescodex: fresh fruits and vegetables standard for fresh and quick frozen raw scallop productsagreed water and phosphates are added to some forms of quick frozen scallop meat to keep it moist and maintain flavour, but they can also increase the products weight and lead to unfair trade practices. the codex alimentarius commission has adopted a new standard for fresh and quick frozen raw scallop products that sets out recommendations including storage temperatures, hygiene and handling practices, labeling, and permitted levels of added water, phosphates and salt. it recommends no more than 2200 mg/kg of phosphates should be present in processed scallop meat. whole scallops (with shell and viscera attached) are already covered by an existing standard for live and raw bivalve molluscs.report of the last meeting of the codex committee on fish and fishery productsstandard for live and raw bivalve mollusc veterinary drugsagreed the codex alimentarius commission has recommended that, due to potential adverse effects on human health, certain veterinary drugs should not be used in food-producing animals. the drugs include some antimicriobials and growth promoters. if given to food-producing animals, residual amounts of these drugs can remain in the meat, milk, eggs, or honey they produce. report of the last meeting of the codex committee on residues of veterinary drugs in food code of hygienic practice for spices and dried aromatic herbs agreed products such as pepper, oregano and thyme go through a long process of primary production, processing (e.g. drying), packaging, storage and transportation before they reach the consumer. this exposes them to potential contamination with microbes (e.g. salmonella, clostridium), with chemicals (e.g. pesticides, heavy metals), and physical contamination (e.g. with stones, glass). the safety of herbs and spices can also be affected by certain moulds that produce toxins. the codex alimentarius commission has adopted a new code of hygienic practice that will help minimize contamination, at all stages of the production, to assure that the spices that reach the consumer are safe. the code includes recommendations on the location of production sites, personnel health and hygiene, equipment, storage and transportation.report of the last meeting of the codex committee on food hygiene new quality criteria to be developed for booming

""we are only nine seasons away from 2030,"" said the fao director-general, qu dongyu, in his keynote remarks, alluding to sustainable development goal 2 (ending hunger by 2030). ""trade is a powerful tool,"" he emphasized, pointing to three cardinal ways to put that power to use: avoid raising trade barriers, especially in periods of crisis; formulate coherent and aligned policies to address trade-offs; and harness the power of digital solutions and innovation. innovation can solve contradictions that affect the dynamics of any single commodity, he said. ""coherent, complementary production systems are the key to agri-food system transformation."" the ccp tracks agricultural commodity markets and related policy issues. established in 1949, it is fao's oldest technical committee and consists of 110 fao members along with observers, tasked with reviewing commodity problems of an international character affecting production, trade, distribution and consumption, and suggesting policy options. ""trade is both vital and complicated, as we need responsible trade and sustainable trade - we have lacked that concept adequately in the past and will need it in the future,"" professor jeffrey sachs, director of the center for sustainable development at columbia university in the united states of america, said in his keynote speech. today, emerging digital technologies, including tools such as fao's hand-in-hand geospatial platform, can finally provide ways for trading rules and agri-food systems to address holistically the complex dimensions linked to environmental and social sustainability, he noted. such issues should move to the top of the international agenda as they represent significant choices that the world's smallholder farmers will need to make in the next 10 to 20 years, sachs added.the ccp works for ""more transparent and inclusive agricultural markets,"" said ambassador esti andayani, permanent representative of the republic of indonesia to fao, speaking on behalf of the ccp bureau.trade-offs and multiple goalstoday's discussion was facilitated by a new fao report, trade and sustainable development goal 2 - policy options and their trade-offs, that assesses pathways to achieve the five targets set out by sdg 2: ending hunger; ending all forms of malnutrition; doubling the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers; ensuring sustainable food production systems; and maintaining genetic diversity.  trade is often a policy priority area for fao members and is also a ""means of implementation"" for achieving the sdgs, the report states. while sdg 2 commits countries to ""correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets"", harnessing international trade to achieve the sdg agenda requires addressing the trade-offs between economic, social and environmental outcomes. government interventions may be required to address market failures, for example to protect biodiversity, minimize damage to the climate or achieve certain social outcomes, according to the report. to ensure progress towards sdg2, ""governments will need to go beyond a narrow focus on the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, and take a broader approach to indicators of progress that encompasses the range of measures that affect trade and markets in the global food system,"" boubaker ben-belhassen, secretary of the ccp and director of fao's markets and trade division, said.the value of global agricultural trade has increased enormously in the past two decades, and its structure and patterns have evolved and will continue to do so. significantly, emerging economies account for an increasing share of global exports, while south-south ties have deepened, with more than half of all the agricultural imports of middle- and low-income countries now sourced from within this group. national measures restricting food exports to protect domestic food security have often led to adverse outcomes, such as favouring urban non-poor households and food processing businesses at the expense of farmers, many of whom are poor, as well as creating uncertainty in world markets. at the same time, the report notes that subsidy schemes may have effects beyond trade and impact the environment or climate trends - considerations that could enrich multilateral negotiations such as those conducted under the aegis of the world trade organization (wto).today's event also featured a panel discussion between senior representatives of the wto, the un development programme (undp) and the international institute for sustainable development (iisd). ""we should not be afraid of global value chains - on the contrary, we must make them inclusive for smallholders,"" so that trade can contribute to the struggle against inequality as well as poverty and hunger, said fao chief economist maximo torero, who moderated the event. what is critical is to achieve policy coherence and the alignment of incentives to incorporate trade-offs and the true cost of trade, he said. the ccp's 73rd (extraordinary) session is on 22 january and the 74th session on 10-12 march 2021.",2021-04-16

""our data set supports both research and policy for transforming food systems to sustainably meet the increasing demands of urban markets.""the findings highlight how the notion that higher-income countries are more urban is too simplistic. for example, more than half the rural populations in low-income countries live in high-density areas, six times more than is the case in high-income countries. that partly reflects a penchant for low-density suburban housing in affluent nations, as well as the way better road infrastructure can make it easier to live further - in distance rather than time - from the center of the local urca. more poignantly, the evidence shows that while large cities are now home to more than 40 percent of the world's urban population, and nearly 50 percent for latin america and the caribbean, they draw proportionally fewer people into their functional orbit than smaller cities. the dominance of small cities and towns and their catchment areas in low per capita income countries highlights the need for policies aimed at improving off-farm employment opportunities, education and health services, as well as for local food systems and for appropriate land-use strategies and transportation infrastructure investments.the data provided can support a territorial perspective -already tested in high-income countries - that takes account of interlinkages between cities and their surrounding rural areas, leading to greater access to off-farm employment, a better-integrated local agri-food system, and less migration.",2021-04-16

""the fast pace of development of sea cucumber fisheries to supply growing international demand is placing most fisheries and many sea cucumber species at risk,"" according to the study ""sea cucumbers: a global review of fisheries and trade."" sea cucumber management plans specific to local circumstances need to be developed, it says. these could include such measures as establishing catch quotas and minimum size limits, closures during breeding seasons, and better monitoring of the status of stocks.economically important sea cucumbers make a substantial contribution to the economies of coastal communities, being in some places the most economically important fishery and non-finfish export  highlighting the need to improve management and fishing practices. but effective management plans for sea cucumber fisheries are uncommon, making it difficult to limit overfishing, fao's report says. it also identifies additional threats for sea cucumber populations worldwide, including global warming, habitat destruction, and illegal fishing. asia and the pacific are the top sea cucumber producing regions, with total regional production running between 20 000 and 40 000 tonnes per year.  however, ecuador's galapagos islands, the seychelles in the indian ocean, and newfoundland in canada are also hotspots for production.ancient delicacy, new age applications in a complicated process of boiling and smoke-drying, the skin of sea cucumbers  also known by the more dulcet french sobriquet bêche-de-mer  is dried for preservation purposes and later rehydrated for use in cooking. in malaysia, they're called trepang, in japan, namako, and in the philippines, balatan.  the chinese poach the sea cukes, smother them in a thick sauce of garlic, ginger, onion and soy sauce and call them hai sum. whole bêche-de-mer can be stuffed with a filling of pork, cornstarch and chopped fried fish. like their terrestrial cousins, sea cucumbers can  unsurprisingly, perhaps  also be pickled. even in spain, some folks have started to scarf these strange sea critters down. up to ten years ago they were considered relatively worthless by catalan fishermen, who had eaten them on boats for years but never brought them to shore. then, a few top chefs in barcelona got in on the act. cooked fresh and quickly on a hot griddle, espardenyes are served with olive oil, sea salt and a squeeze of lemon. aside from their use in cooking, there's also an emerging market for the use of sea cucumbers in the pharmaceutical, nutriceutical and cosmetic industries. sometimes, internal organs such as gonads and intestines are fermented or dried to produce high priced specialty products used as dietary supplements. odds and endssea cucumbers are by any measure, eastern or western, an interesting organism. they can essentially liquefy their body mass on command, allowing them to ""pour themselves"" into narrow openings. some species defend themselves by ripping a hole in the lining of their abdominal wall and expelling frondy parts of their breathing organs, which they use to entangle predators and then later regrow. others have symbiotic relationships with small fish that live in their anuses.",2021-04-16

""what climate change does is to bring back uncertainties from the time we were all hunter gatherers. we cannot assure any more that we will have the harvest we have planted."" that uncertainty also translates into volatile food prices, he noted.

""the benefits of adaptation outweigh the costs of inaction by very wide margins,"" emphasized graziano da silva. time for commitments to be put into action""2016 should be about putting commitments into action,"" urged graziano da silva, noting the international community last year agreed to the sustainable development goals and the paris climate agreement, about to come into force. agriculture will be high on the agenda at the 22nd conference of the parties in morocco starting  november 7.  the fao report underscores that success in transforming food and agriculture systems will largely depend on urgently supporting smallholders in adapting to climate change.developing countries are home to around half a billion smallholder farm families who produce food and other agricultural products in greatly varying agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions. solutions have to be tailored to those conditions; there is no one-size-fits-all fix.the fao report describes alternative, economically viable ways of helping smallholders to adapt and making the livelihoods of rural populations  often the most exposed to the downside risks of climate change - more resilient. the report provides evidence that adoption of climate-smart' practices, such as the use of nitrogen-efficient and heat-tolerant crop varieties, zero-tillage and integrated soil fertility management would boost productivity and farmers' incomes. widespread adoption of nitrogen-efficient practices alone would reduce the number of people at risk of undernourishment by more than 100 million, the report estimates.it also identifies avenues to lower emission intensity from agriculture. water-conserving alternatives to the flooding of rice paddies for example, can slash methane emissions by 45 percent, while emissions from the livestock sector can be reduced by up to 41 percent through the adoption of more efficient practices.fao's road map also identifies policies and financing opportunities for the sustainable intensification of agriculture. the way forwardnegative global effects of climate change are already being felt in some cereal crop yields,. climate change will likely lead to a loss of nutritional content of some foods, such as declining zinc, iron and protein counts in staple cereals, and trigger new health issues  including diarrhoea for humans and an array of transboundary animal diseases. beyond 2030, according to scientific evidence, negative pressures on food production will be increasingly felt everywhere. until then, adverse impacts of higher temperatures are sharply skewed towards developing countries, pointing to dimmer prospects for their food self-sufficiency.helping smallholders adapt to climate change risks is critical for global poverty reduction and food security. close attention should be paid to removing obstacles they may face and fostering an enabling environment for individual, joint and collective action, according to the report. fao urges policy makers to identify and remove such barriers. these obstacles can include input subsidies that promote unsustainable farming practices, poorly aligned incentives and inadequate access to markets, credit, extension services and social protection programmes, and often disadvantage women, who make up to 43 percent of the agricultural labour force. the report stresses that more climate finance is needed to fund developing countries' actions on climate change.  international public finance for climate change adaptation and mitigation is growing and, while still relatively small, can act as a catalyst to leverage larger flows of public and private investments. more climate finance needs to flow to sustainable agriculture, fisheries and forestry to fund the large-scale transformation and the development of climate-smart food production systems. adaptation and mitigation of climate change must  occur in tandem.  without action, agriculture will continue to be a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. but by adopting climate-smart practices and increasing the capacity of soils and forests to sequester carbon, emissions can be reduced while stepping up food production to feed the world's growing population, the report said. food systems can further contribute by minimizing food losses and waste, as well as by promoting healthier diets that also leave a lighter environmental footprint.",2021-04-16

""in the past, the system could cope with episodes of jellyfish abundance , but in the case of the early 1980s blooms, the system went in another direction and is still not back to ""normal"" in pre-pelagia years,"" the report states. jellyfish ocean jellyfish have now become persistently abundant in almost all the oceans of the world,  leading some experts to speak of  ""a global regime shift from a fish to a jellyfish ocean"" in which  jellyfish supplant fish.  although the reasons for the phenomenon are not fully understood, they may include, besides overfishing: global warming, which enhances species that thrive at tropical latitudes. eutrophication, which increases nutrients in the water.  widespread use of sea walls to prevent coastal erosion and the large number of tourist harbours, which make an ideal habitat for those jellyfish who go through a stage as polyps in their early lives.  measures advocated to prevent or cope with jellyfish blooms include: incorporate jellyfish research into fisheries research. develop jellyfish products for food and medicine. some jellyfish species are a food source in several countries.   among other possibilities, the discovery of an ""immortal jellyfish"", turritopsis nutricula, capable of reversing its ageing process, holds out the promise of developing powerful rejuvenation products for humans.  establish early warning systems of jellyfish blooms, with protective barriers for aquaculture farms.  taking steps to reduce overfishing, greenhouse gas emissions and the causes of eutrophication ""would undoubtedly improve environmental quality at large and might, thus, also reduce the present prevalence of jellyfish,"" the report adds.",2021-04-16

""sustainable tourism has proven one of the most effective ways of providing economic and employment opportunities for local communities while protecting the world's natural resources,"" said taleb rifai, wto's secretary-general.ecotourism, characterized by responsible travel to natural areas that promotes conservation of the environment, is one of the fastest growing segments of tourism worldwide, and is growing at a pace of more than 20 percent annually -  two to three times faster than the tourism industry overall.""for many people, there is an attitude of ""we had better see it while it is still there to see"" when it comes to visiting threatened forests or endangered wildlife,"" said patrick durst, a senior forestry official with the un's food and agriculture organization (fao), working in asia.local benefitsecotourism can provide local communities with motivation to maintain and protect forests and wildlife.  when local people get income and employment from ecotourism, they are far less likely to destroy the natural resources through unsustainable exploitation.""ecotourism has a far greater potential for contributing to income and livelihoods in poor rural communities than what is realized,"" noted fao's edgar kaeslin, forestry officer in wildlife and protected area management. ""it is crucial that local people are fully involved in the activities and receive sufficient benefits.""the benefits of ecotourism flowing to local businesses are dramatically higher than those from mass tourism.  standard all-inclusive package tours typically deliver just 20 percent of revenue to local companies, while the rest is captured by airlines, hotels and large tour companies, whereas locally-based ecotourism operations that hire locally and are based locally can return as much as 95 percent of earnings into the local economy.excessive ecotourism poses dangershowever, failure to limit tourist numbers at popular sites can quickly overload ecosystems and damage fragile natural resources, sometimes permanently.also, as with most economic endeavors, when profits are to be made, there is a risk that powerful players will dominate and squeeze out smaller local operators.  under the guise of ""ecotourism"" less scrupulous enterprises sometime have wittingly or unwittingly introduced negative influences to local people, disrupted local economies and tarnished unique indigenous cultures. in some of the worst instances, indigenous peoples have even been displaced or dispossessed of traditional access to natural areas.ecotourism as sustainable forest managementthe best ecotourism programmes strive to regulate against such abuses and guide it toward maximizing local benefits.  training for local people is crucial to ensure they can compete successfully for desirable ecotourism jobs. training for local people is crucial to ensure they can compete successfully for desirable ecotourism jobs. one prominent example is the ecotourist trade involving critically endangered mountain gorillas in rwanda, uganda and the democratic republic of congo. tourism in those countries generates significant incentives for governments and local communities to conserve their rich environment instead of choosing unsustainable pathways to development, said doug cress, coordinator of the unep led great apes survival partnership (grasp).""mountain gorillas are the only species of great ape that are actually rising in numbers,"" cress said.

""in today's world of unprecedented technical and economic opportunities, we find it entirely unacceptable that more than 100 million children under five are underweight, and therefore unable to realize their full human and socio-economic potential, and that childhood malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 2.5 million children every year,"" say josé graziano da silva, kanayo f. nwanze and ertharin cousin, respectively the heads of fao, ifad and wfp, in a foreword to the report.""we note with particular concern that the recovery of the world economy from the recent global financial crisis remains fragile. we nonetheless appeal to the international community to make extra efforts to assist the poorest in realizing their basic human right to adequate food. the world has the knowledge and the means to eliminate all forms of food insecurity and malnutrition,"" they add. a ""twin-track"" approach is needed, based on support for broad-based economic growth (including in agriculture) and safety nets for the most vulnerable.impact of economic crisisthe new estimates suggest that the increase in hunger during 2007-2010 was less severe than previously thought. the 2008-2009 economic crisis did not cause  an immediate sharp economic slowdown in many developing countries as was feared could happen; the transmission of international food prices to domestic markets was less pronounced than was assumed at the time while many governments succeeded in cushioning the shocks and protecting the most vulnerable from the effects of the price spike. the numbers of hunger released today are part of a revised series that go back to 1990. it uses updated information on population, food supply, food losses, dietary energy requirements and other factors. they also better estimate the distribution of food (as measured in terms of  dietary energy supply) within countries. sofi 2012 notes that the methodology does not capture the short-term effects of food price surges and other economic shocks. fao is also working to develop a wider set of indicators to better capture dietary quality and other dimensions of food security.mdg target within reachthe report suggests that if appropriate actions are taken to reverse the slowdown in 2007-08 and to feed the hungry, achieving the millennium development goal (mdg) of reducing by half the share of hungry people in the developing world by 2015 is still within reach. ""if the average annual hunger reduction of the past 20 years continues through to 2015, the percentage of undernourishment in the developing countries would reach 12.5 percent - still above the mdg target of 11.6 percent, but much closer to it than previously estimated,"" the report says.  asia leads in number of hungry; hunger rises in africaamong the regions, undernourishment in the past two decades decreased nearly 30 percent in asia and the pacific, from 739 million to 563 million, largely due to socio-economic progress in many countries in the region. despite population growth, the prevalence of undernourishment in the region decreased from 23.7 percent to 13.9 percent. latin america and the caribbean also made progress,  falling from 65 million hungry in 1990-1992 to 49 million in 2010-2012, while the prevalence of undernourishment dipped from 14.6 percent to 8.3 percent. but the rate of progress has slowed recently. africa was the only region where the number of hungry grew over the period, from 175 million to 239 million, with nearly 20 million added in the past four years. the prevalence of hunger, although reduced over the entire period, has risen slightly over the past three years, from 22.6 percent to 22.9 percent - with nearly one in four hungry. and in sub-saharan africa, the modest progress achieved in recent years up to 2007 was reversed, with hunger rising 2 percent per year since then. developed regions also saw the number of hungry rise, from 13 million in 2004-2006 to 16 million in 2010-2012, reversing a steady decrease in previous years from 20 million in 1990-1992.agricultural growth to reduce hunger and malnutritionthe report underlines that overall growth is necessary but not sufficient for a sustained hunger reduction. agricultural growth is particularly effective in reducing hunger and malnutrition in poor countries since most of the poor depend on agriculture and related activities for at least part of their livelihoods. agricultural growth involving smallholders, especially women, will be most effective in reducing extreme poverty and hunger when it generates employment for the poor. growth must not only benefit the poor, but must also be ""nutrition-sensitive"" in order to reduce various forms of malnutrition. reducing hunger is about more than just increasing the quantity of food it is also about increasing the quality of food in terms of diversity, nutrient content and safety. for even while 870 million people remain hungry, the world is increasingly faced with a double burden of malnutrition, with chronic undernourishment and micronutrient malnutrition co-existing with obesity, overweight  and related non-communicable diseases (affecting more than 1.4 billion people worldwide). to date, the linkage between economic growth and better nutrition has been weak, the report says, arguing for an integrated agriculture-nutrition-health framework.social protection systems growth is clearly important, but it is not always sufficient, or rapid enough. hence, social protection systems are needed to ensure that the most vulnerable are not left behind and can also participate in, contribute to and benefit from growth. measures such as cash transfers, food vouchers or health insurance are needed for the most vulnerable who often cannot take immediate advantage of growth opportunities. social protection can improve nutrition for young children - an investment that will pay off in the future with better educated, stronger and healthier adults. with effective social protection complementing inclusive economic growth, hunger and malnutrition can be eliminated.",2021-04-16

""the shocks of the past year will reverberate long into 2021 and beyond, and we need to urgently scale up actions to avert a worst-case scenario,"" said dominique burgeon, director of fao's emergencies and resilience division.  of extreme concern are the estimated 30 million people in integrated food security phase classification (ipc) phase 4 or emergency levels of acute hunger, who are already experiencing excess mortality and the irreversible loss of vital livelihood assets.  hundreds of thousands of girls, boys, women and men are at extreme risk of acute food insecurity in several countries. many are living in conflict zones where humanitarian access is restricted or challenging.  ""millions are living on the precipice - one stress or shock away from a rapid deterioration. with or without famine declarations, we need to act now,"" burgeon added.  many depend on agriculture for their lives and livelihoods agriculture is critical as nearly four out of five people live in rural areas and rely on some form of agricultural production for their livelihoods. the most severe manifestation of acute hunger remains a largely rural phenomenon so averting famine must therefore begin in rural areas and include large-scale and collective action to save livelihoods and lives.  fao has already provided critical livelihood support to safeguard the livelihoods of over 24 million people against the socio-economic impacts of covid-19. desert locust control operations have also had an impact in the greater horn of africa and yemen where fao has protected over 3.1 million tonnes of cereal, worth $939 million, enough to feed more than 20.8 million people for a year and protect more than 1.5 million pastoral households.  with fao's support, those affected can have the means and the capacity to produce the food needed to stave off acute hunger.fao targets assistance to acutely food insecure fao's emergency response in 2021 will focus on providing assistance to highly food-insecure communities in more than 30 countries including the democratic republic of the congo, ethiopia, somalia, south sudan, syria and yemen.  yemen is suffering the world's worst humanitarian crisis as a consequence of conflict and economic collapse. farmers have also had to deal with desert locusts and natural disasters. fao aims to reach 6.3 million people with high impact interventions combining cash and agricultural livelihoods support and promoting community resilience. in syria, 12 million people will benefit from restoring agricultural livelihoods and value chains while in ethiopia, the organization aims to assist 6.7 million people facing acute hunger and another 6 million people in south sudan to improve their food security, resilience and agricultural production. recognizing that close monitoring and agility are crucial tools in preventing rapid deterioration, fao will continue to expand its anticipatory action linked to early warnings in 2021 to protect livelihoods before a disaster.  ""we will continue investing in the most vulnerable people and their livelihoods so that they can lead their future recovery and pull themselves out of acute hunger,"" said burgeon.",2021-04-16

""evidence shows that in low-income countries, investing in agriculture - especially in family farming and small-scale agriculture - has a greater impact on reducing poverty than investing in other sectors,"" noted fao director-general, qu dongyu who went on to stress that pro-poor growth also required creating off-farm jobs, fostering economic diversification and investing in human capital, health, education and infrastructure.  extreme poverty in rural areas is three times higher than in urban areas. about 80 percent of the world's extremely poor reside in rural areas and most have to cope with limited access to often degraded resources. the covid-19 pandemic has aggravated this situation, exacerbating inequalities and negatively impacting the lives and well-being of the rural poor -in particular of women, indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities and youth.the president of the 75th session of the united nations general assembly, volkan bozkir, in a video message, underlined that ""in recovering from the covid-19 pandemic, we must focus on strengthening local and inclusive food systems to ensure sustained, resilient food security and poverty reduction. this includes moving from an agricultural perspective to agri-food perspective where the value addition of agriculture is appropriately recognized."" the un under-secretary-general for economic and social affairs, liu zhenmin, stressed the importance of working together to address the challenges at hand. ""a coordinated international response and recovery effort is very much needed to fight the pandemic, lift rural populations out of poverty, and ensure no one is left behind,"" said liu.the president of ifad, gilbert f. houngbo, emphasized that ""today's pandemic increases the urgency to make our food systems not only more sustainable but also more resilient, as well as inclusive and fair. i cannot insist enough on the importance of focusing our attention on the small-scale producers if we really want to boot out poverty and achieve sdg1 and sdg2 by 2030.""the director of wfp's humanitarian and development programme, david kaatrud, elaborated on the agency's resilience-building activities in rural communities. ""studies have shown that resilience programmes are a cost-efficient investment for reducing need and preventing crises. for instance, a recent wfp analysis found that each us$1 spent on an integrated package of resilience activities in niger would generate a return of us$3.67 over a 20-year period,"" he said. as collaborators of the event, the permanent representative of china to the un, ambassador zhang jun, and the head of the eu delegation to the un, ambassador olof skoog, helped set the stage for the discussions in the opening segment of today's event.ambassador zhang stated that ""accelerating rural poverty reduction and transforming food systems should be prioritized for post covid-19 recovery and the implementation of the 2030 agenda."" ambassador skoog stressed the urgency to act. ""in the time of covid-19, one thing became crystal clear: addressing food security and ensuring proper nutrition for all is urgent,"" he said, also underscoring the strong interlinkages between healthy people, healthy societies and a healthy planet which are recognized in the eu's farm to fork strategy.using and creating opportunities to end rural poverty the un food systems summit 2021 and multilateral efforts to build back better from the covid-19 pandemic offer unique opportunities to identify and promote actions in favour of the rural poor. fao's hand-in-hand initiative is a complimentary, multi-sectoral and partnership-focused approach. it aims to reduce poverty by improving agricultural potential through investing in innovative, inclusive and productive value chains and building human capital.as the fao director-general remarked, ""we have nine harvests remaining until 2030 and achieving the sustainable development goals, and we must galvanize more partners around this urgency to work together on understanding the needs of different agri-food systems around the world, and jointly address how to accelerate solutions."" in line with this, fao launched in july this year its covid-19 response and recovery programme aimed at preventing a global food emergency during and after the pandemic, while working on medium- to long-term development responses for food security and nutrition. the event ""transforming agri-food systems and fostering inclusive rural development in the context of covid-19 to end rural poverty"" was moderated by fao chief economist, máximo torero.",2021-04-16

""despite relative progress, there has been a new upsurge of desert locusts that has destroyed crops. we will continue working as a combined force to combat the threat of desert locusts and mitigate the potential of a more devastating outcome,"" said said hussein iid, somalia's minister of agriculture and irrigation.  the report highlights that desert locusts will continue to pose a serious risk of damage to both pasture and crops countrywide through mid-2021. in addition, available forecasts indicate an increased likelihood of below-average rainfall during the 2021 gu (april-june) season across most of the country, which would further exacerbate food and nutrition insecurity for millions of people.  ""with the government's support, our teams and partners have maintained operations in control and surveillance, while delivering crucial humanitarian assistance and livelihood support during extremely challenging circumstances. expanding the emergency response is crucial and underway, with a focus on interventions aimed at reducing food consumption gaps, saving lives, and protecting and preserving livelihoods,"" said etienne peterschmitt, fao representative in somalia.  from july to december 2020, assistance reached more than 1.8 million people per month on average in parts of somalia. this large-scale humanitarian and government support helped to minimize the magnitude of the crisis and funding is needed urgently to boost efforts to reduce the new food security threats the country is currently facing.  food insecurity expected to deteriorate approximately 1.6 million people face crisis (ipc phase 3) or worse outcomes in the presence of planned humanitarian assistance during the first quarter of 2021. an additional 2.5 million people are stressed (ipc phase 2), bringing the total number of people experiencing acute food insecurity to 4.1 million. this also includes approximately 840 000 children under the age of five who are likely to be acutely malnourished, including nearly 143 000 who are likely to be severely malnourished.  according to fsnau-fews net, from april to june 2021, food insecurity is expected to deteriorate, largely among poor rural, urban and displaced populations, due to the multitude of threats and crises. humanitarian assistance must be sustained through mid-2021 to prevent crisis (ipc phase 3) or emergency (ipc phase 4) outcomes for nearly 2.7 million people.

""digital agriculture has allowed governments to support smallholders during this pandemic, and it should also be a path to creating a better system for the future,"" said kremer, who drew on recently published research that found information sharing through mobile telephony catalyzed significant and measurable improvements on yields and adoption of recommended agro-chemical inputs across sub-saharan africa and india. ""digital technology is not only about economics, but digital governance, digital society and a digital world"" said fao director-general qu dongyu. he also noted his invited guest's lecture was held on international day for rural women, who often have limited access to mobile phones- which he calls a ""new farming tool"". emphasizing the importance of rural areas and smallholders, he urged that the ""development deficit"" between countries must not be replicated in a similar digital divide. kremer discussed future prospects for digital agriculture, including the provision of higher-resolution weather information, customized pest-control advice, opportunities to improve supply chains and ways to improve extension services. now a professor at the university of chicago, he won the 2019 sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel together with esther duflo and abhijit banerjee in recognition of work that took experimental approaches to alleviating global poverty, including the innovative use of randomized control trials to answer key development questions related to agriculture, water, education and health. his personal and professional output also involves leading roles in organizations that promote precision agriculture, advanced market commitments to stimulate development and distribution of vaccines in the developing world, and private philanthropy to effective charities. under qu's leadership, fao has accelerated promotion of digital agriculture and the use of smartphones to boost the productivity and livelihoods of the world's poorest - an effort that became even more critical due to the disruptions to the world's food systems - as well as work methods at fao and other organizations - caused by the covid-19 pandemic.  highlights include the creation of an office of innovation headed by the  first ever fao's chief scientist, the launch of the hand-in-hand geospatial data platform - which provides public, verified and impartial data as part of an initiative to bring more stakeholders into development efforts -  and an agreement backed by more than 70 agriculture ministers to establish an international platform for digital food and agriculture - which qu invited kremer to join. ongoing fao work uses mobile and digital technologies to help members and farmers to combat invasive species and deforestation, optimize water management and land use patterns and spread knowledge on food safety standards and e-commerce opportunities.professor kremer noted fao's leading role in investing in research into ""global public goods for the future.""the director-general said that kremer's work - which elicited a lively question-and-answer session with permanent representatives, fao directors, technical staff -  is ""close to our heart and mandate"" and highlighted the importance of understanding that ""farmer, agriculture and rural"", while interlinked, are three distinct issues articulated in local cultures.from results to impactswhile open to the public and webcast on fao's web site, professor kremer's virtual seminar was hosted by fao's impact evaluation task force, set up last year with the aim of fast-tracking an agile culture of evaluation and improve the value-for-money proposition the organization makes to members and stakeholders as well as to partners in the united nations system and beyond. the task force, which reports to fao's chief economist máximo torero, aims to bolster within fao - both across headquarter divisions and including regional, liaison and country offices - a culture of evaluation that moves beyond reporting on outputs and results towards an emphasis on impact and outcomes. the task force members organize impact evaluation clinics to analyze and assess actual projects and programmes, as well as a seminar series featuring guests such as professor kremer and other leading international experts.",2021-04-16

""we have to be vigilant and make sure we have the capacity to take fast action if for any reason it reappears.""""the current rinderpest's absence in the field actually means livestock herds would be highly vulnerable in case of its re-emergence, wreaking significant disruption and damage to food safety and food security throughout the world,"" said matthew stone, deputy director general in charge of international standards and science at the oie, which was established in 1924 in large measure to stamp out rinderpest. the global action plan encompasses five phases: preparation, prevention, detection, response and recovery. as rinderpest has been eradicated, the action plan to address the risk of re-emergence is distinct from other plans targeting transboundary animal diseases.that entails keeping front-line actors aware of the disease and the possibility of its re-emergence. several actions have already been put in place to meet this objective, such as the ""never turn back"" oie communication campaign targeting laboratory staff, veterinary practitioners and veterinary students. the global rinderpest action plan also entails optimizing capacity to make diagnostic tools and vaccines available if needed, a coordinated emergency plan that can be immediately activated upon the first confirmed case, assuring both a rapid return to global freedom from the disease and necessary support for affected livelihoods. all of these phases need attention at the national, regional and international level. getting rid of what's leftone reason that diagnostic and vaccine capacities for rinderpest are low is that the eradication campaign put a ban on using the virus except in highly controlled experiments supervised by oie and fao. however, there are still some institutes around the world holding rinderpest virus material - including vaccines from the past. these samples either need to be destroyed or moved to safe laboratories. by contrast, samples of the smallpox virus, the only other infectious disease to have been formally eradicated, exist in just two designated secure storage zones.   ideally, countries might opt to destroy their rinderpest virus holdings, and fao and oie run a program helping them to do this. the two organizations also support key institutions where samples - which might be useful to derive vaccines in an emergency - can be safely stored. alternatively, countries might upgrade their holding facilities in conformity with fao and oie supervision protocols. so far, however, progress in eliminating residual holdings has proven slow. only in the african union has there been a regional agreement to sequester all virus samples in a single selected facility. what was eradicatedrinderpest, sometimes called cattle plague or steppe murrain, has been a scourge for millennia and has killed millions of animals, including some wild species. it is part of a group of viruses including canine distemper, peste des petits ruminants and the measles virus for humans. after wreaking havoc in europe and asia for centuries, colonial invasions brought the disease to africa, where it wrought vast damage in the late 19th century, decimating pastoralist communities - it triggered a crisis one community called ""the end of everything"" (ciinna) -  re-arranging ecosystems and often facilitating colonial occupation of lands. its eradication allows the continent to avoid loss of $920 million a year, according to fao's estimates. a vaccine was created in the mid-20th century, but it took a few more decades to develop a version that could survive temperature variations in tropical countries. pastoralists themselves played a critical role in the eradication campaign, thanks to their deep local knowledge and willingness to travel in adverse circumstances to remote areas. fao and oie are using the successful rinderpest eradication programme as a model for a new campaign to rid the world of peste des petits ruminants, which affects sheep and goats and causes up to $2.1 billion a year in losses, mostly shouldered by small-scale farmers.",2021-04-16

""with a final push in the next couple of years, we can still reach the mdg target,"" wrote the heads of fao, ifad and wfp, josé graziano da silva, kanayo f. nwanze and ertharin cousin in their foreword to the report. they called for nutrition-sensitive interventions in agriculture and food systems as a whole, as well as in public health and education, especially for women. ""policies aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity and increasing food availability, especially when smallholders are targeted, can achieve hunger reduction even where poverty is widespread. when they are combined with social protection and other measures that increase the incomes of poor families, they can have an even more positive effect and spur rural development, by creating vibrant markets and employment opportunities, resulting in equitable economic growth,"" the agency heads said. pro-poor policies needed the report underlines that economic growth is key for progress in hunger reduction. but growth may not lead to more and better jobs and incomes for all, unless policies specifically target the poor, especially those in rural areas. ""in poor countries, hunger and poverty reduction will only be achieved with growth that is not only sustained, but also broadly shared,"" the report noted.  tackling malnutrition, child stunting the un hunger report not only measures chronic hunger but presents a new suite of indicators for every country to capture the multiple dimensions of food insecurity. these indicators give a more nuanced picture of food insecurity in a country. in some countries, for example, the prevalence of hunger can be low, while at the same time undernutrition rates can be quite high, as exemplified by the proportion of children who are stunted (low height for age) or underweight, whose future health and development are put at risk. such distinctions are important to improve the effectiveness of measures to reduce hunger and food insecurity in all its dimensions. the findings and recommendations of sofi 2013 will be discussed by governments, civil society and private sector representatives at the 7-11 october meeting of the committee on world food security, at fao headquarters in rome.",2021-04-16

""when people resort to these measures, they have no resilience against future shocks,"" said claude jibidar, representative and country director of the un world food programme (wfp) in afghanistan today. ""these figures are extremely alarming, especially in a country where more than one third of all people are already food insecure. this report could portent a future spike in the next 12 months in the need for food and other humanitarian assistance."" ""although afghanistan will produce slightly more wheat this year, a large number of poor and hungry people will not be able to purchase food from the market,"" said tomio shichiri, food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) representative in afghanistan. ""it is a question of access to food rather than its production. special attention needs to be given to female-headed households and displaced people to improve their access to, and improvements of, agriculture-based livelihoods.""   the report shows that female-headed households are almost 50 percent more likely to be severely food insecure than other households in afghanistan, having a much poorer diet than their peers and a much lower income. women who head their household are also twice as likely to use emergency coping strategies, such as begging.  people displaced from their homes by conflicts or disasters, particularly those living in tents, also suffer from poor diets.  khost and paktika provinces, which host over 35,000 displaced households (more than 200,000 people), need immediate support to prevent food insecurity from worsening.    fsac, fao, wfp and the government report that a lack of funding could exacerbate this problem even further. ""it is the last resort when farmers start selling productive assets such as livestock, machinery or land,"" said mr. abdul majid, fsac coordinator. ""this is not only a loss for farmers but for the entire community - as skills and means for agricultural production will be lost - saturating the urban labour market.""   ""it is striking to know that one third of the afghan population is food insecure and their situation continues to worsen,"" said he assadullah zamir, minister of agriculture, irrigation and livestock. ""we request the donor community to continue assisting the most vulnerable afghans before it becomes too late."" access the full report, here. notes for editors: about the food security and agriculture cluster (fsac): the fsac has been a central part of the humanitarian response in afghanistan since 2008. it is co-led by wfp and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), with a non-governmental organization as co-chair.  over 172 partner organizations country-wide are active in the fsac, including ngos, government ministries un agencies and donors. for more information see: food security and agriculture cluster (fsac) about fao: fao's three main goals are: 1) the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition; 2) the elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all; and 3) the sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.about wfp: wfp is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide, delivering food assistance in emergencies and working with communities to improve nutrition and build resilience. each year, wfp assists some 80 million people in around 75 countries.",2021-04-16
"227","FAO and Chinese partners working to unlock carbon finance for herders and grazers","","30 may 2014, rome - hundreds of millions of people around the world rely on grasslands to feed the livestock which are the foundation of their livelihoods. yet poor land management has left large swathes of the world's grasslands degraded - an environmental problem which also has direct implications for livestock-dependent communities. to help address these concerns, fao and the chinese academy of agriculture science (caas), the world agroforestry center (icraf) and china's northwest institute of plateau biology (nwipb) have for the past several years been working to link grasslands restoration efforts to international climate financing schemes. restoring degraded grasslands through more sustainable grazing practices and forage production can substantially improve animal feeds and productivity, benefiting herders and others who depend on livestock-rearing for income and food. at the same time, restoring degraded grasslands can also trap large volumes of atmospheric carbon, mitigating climate change. for this to happen, economic incentives are critical. carbon crediting schemes that pay projects for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sequestering carbon do exist, in theory offering farmers the potential to earn money in exchange for adopting practices that help mitigate climate change. but participation of agriculture in carbon markets - including those involving grazing-based livelihood systems - has so far been quite small. one reason for this is the challenge of measuring how much carbon is being trapped as a result of improved farming practices. only with reliable and affordable approaches measuring, reporting and verifying carbon sequestration can provide access to climate funds.  this challenge is now being addressed by a new methodology developed by fao, caas, icraf and the nwipb.a new tool, now tested and endorsedthe methodology allows for either direct measurement of carbon sequestration on sustainably managed grasslands through soil sampling or computer modeling of sequestration based on soil types and farming activities. the use of modeling can substantially reduce costs of measurement. tested over the past several years using field data from a project site in northern china and computer modeling, the methodology has now won approval by the non-profit verified carbon standard (vcs), a voluntary greenhouse gas accounting programme used by projects around the world to verify and issue carbon credits in voluntary emissions markets. according to findings from the case study in northern china, herders could sequester an average of 3 tco2 per hectare of grassland each year over the next 20 years, through the application of improved practices, such as reduction and rotation of grazing pressure on overstocked sites and the sowing of improved pastures and fodder crops close to households. the new methodology is tailor-made for the assessment and quantification of those climate benefits. ""now that the tool has won the certification needed for recognition by international carbon markets, project developers and farmers have a new opportunity to implement grasslands restoration projects at a meaningful scale, improving the productive potential of their grasslands and helping to reverse historic carbon losses,"" said henning steinfeld of fao. returns from the carbon finance and other mitigation funds can be invested in further restoring the long-term health of the lands upon which herders and grazers depend and in building up marketing associations to improve their incomes, raising families incomes and improving household food security,"" henning steinfeld added. the methodology also offers countries a tool that can be adapted and used to support monitoring and verification when developing nationally appropriate mitigation actions (namas) to reduce ghg emissions.significant potentialthe methodology can be applied worldwide wherever countries work to sustainably feed a growing population while lowering their carbon footprint, especially in grassland-rich countries.. ""in china -- with 400 million hectares of grasslands, and highly supportive national policies and measures that have been initiated in china to incentivize the uptake of sustainable grassland management practices such as the grassland law of the people's republic of china; the grassland ecology conservation subsidy and reward mechanism; and the grassland retirement program, there is enormous potential for this new methodology,"" noted li yue of caas. caas and fao are continuing to work together to identify opportunities to pilot this methodology and upscale its use in china and beyond.",2021-04-16

about the size of slovenia, says a new fao-plan bleu report - the state of mediterranean forests. but forests in the mediterranean have also been considerably affected by degradation and are increasingly in jeopardy from climate change, population rise, wildfires and water scarcity, the report warns.""mediterranean forests have long been adapting to pressures caused by human development. but never have these pressures been so extreme as they are now,"" said hiroto mitsugi, fao assistant director-general, forestry department.""unless we do more to combat forest degradation, more than 500 million people across 31 countries and three continents will soon face a wide range of economic, social and environmental problems,"" added mitsugi.elen lemaitre-curri, plan bleu's director said: ""in a context of rapid climatic, societal and lifestyle changes in the mediterranean, forest and tree-based solutions are critical to the region overall sustainability, with an expected impact well beyond forested areas. upstream forests, agro-forestry, and urban trees and parks can help preserve key ecosystem services, reduce soil degradation and transition towards a circular, resource-efficient, bio-based, low carbon and socially fair green economy. reaching this potential will require using a range of instruments, including participatory approaches, innovative economic instruments and partnerships.""  mediterranean forests - key figures (1)  mediterranean countries' forest area is about 88 million hectares - the size of france and italy. it represents two percent of the global forest area  overall, the increase in forest area has been slightly greater in northern mediterranean (2) than in southern mediterranean but, on a country basis, the greatest loss of forest area occurred in european countries (the greatest loss of forest area between 1990 and 2015 occurred in portugal, bosnia and herzegovina, and albania)  there are 80 million hectares of degraded lands - including forests - in the mediterranean  protected areas have increased, particularly in regions with small forest areas - north africa hosts four percent of the mediterranean forests, but forest represents nearly a quarter of its protected areas  forests are storing over 5 000 billion tonnes of carbon (about two percent of the global forest carbon), with an increase of 1.65 billion (two percent per year) between 1990 and 2015  over 400 000 hectares of forests are burnt each year at least 339 (16 percent) of mediterranean forest animal and plant species are threatened with extinctiondrivers of mediterranean forests' degradation forest degradation in the north of the mediterranean is driven mostly by land abandonment and fires, whilst forests in the south-east suffer from an overexploitation of fuelwood, overgrazing, and population pressure.  climate change remains the most significant threat to all mediterranean forests. rising temperatures, erratic rain patterns, and longer droughts will significantly alter the cover and distribution of forests and trees over the next years. for example, as trees try to withstand droughts, they deplete their carbon stores and produce less carbohydrates and resins, which are essential to their health. this has already led to a decline or dieback of oak, fir, spruce, beech and pine trees in spain, france, italy and greece, and of atlas cedar trees in algeria. the mediterranean population doubled between 1960 and 2015, reaching 537 million, and is estimated to rise to 670 million by 2050. while there has been little demographic change in the north, rapid population growth in the south-east has led to an excessive exploitation of natural resources.   wildfires remain a significant threat. although the number of fires have decreased in the north and northeast in recent decades, the number of larger fires (affecting over 500 hectares) have increased. the report predicts this trend - overall fewer but larger fires - to continue.   water shortages and soil erosion are particularly harmful to mediterranean forests as soils are thinner and poorer than in other regions. over 300 animal and plant species of mediterranean forests threatened with extinction  the mediterranean region is the world's second largest biodiversity hotspot, but as forests face rising pressures, so are its animals and plants. forests are home to three quarters of mediterranean terrestrial mammal species, nearly half of the region's vertebrate species and almost three quarters of terrestrial insects. forests also hold more than a quarter of the region's higher plant species. forests in spain, italy, greece, turkey and morocco have the highest number of threatened species (26 percent in spain, 24 in italy, 21 in greece, 17 in turkey, 15 in morocco). mediterranean forests are also rich in fungi. however, they are gradually decreasing due to clear-cutting and timber harvesting.   solutions to forest degradation  the report urges countries to scale up the restoration of forests and landscapes. in particular, it recommends:  thinning and planting mixed tree species to reduce droughts' impacts  new firefighting policies that look beyond suppressing fires and include preventative vegetation management, preparedness and restoration activities a regional forest strategy and common policies strengthening forest value chains  mediterranean forests are already part of the green economy, but their contributions could be maximized if green economy-related strategies place greater focus on forests increasing forests, parks, and vegetable gardens in urban areas  creating stronger private-public partnerships for forest management applying fao's guidelines on restoring degraded forests and landscapesthe report covers 27 countries: albania, algeria, bosnia and herzegovina, bulgaria, croatia, cyprus, egypt, france, greece, israel, italy, jordan, lebanon, libya, the former yugoslav republic of macedonia, malta, monaco, montenegro, morocco, palestine, portugal, serbia, slovenia, spain, syrian arab republic, tunisia and turkey.(1) all figures are from 2015 (unless specified otherwise), latest data available(2) for a map of mediterranean areas as defined by the report, please see page 3 of the report",2021-04-16

""the global food import bill for the whole of 2020 may even exceed that of 2019,"" says josef schmidhuber, co-author with bing qiao - both fao economists - of the chapter. ""there is, however, a noticeable shift away from high value food items to staples.""developing countries have demonstrated notable ""vivacity"" in buoying global food trade flows, the analysis shows. their export earnings in the first half of 2020 rose by 4.6 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, while those of developed countries declined. that is partly explained by the sharpest drops occurring for beverages, fish and meat, the demand for which is more responsive to the declines in household incomes triggered by the contracting global economy. over the same period, world imports of beverages fell by more than 12 percent and fish products declined by more than 10 percent, while the value of trade in animal and vegetable oils and oilseeds both increased by almost 10 percent. the report offers a rich series of graphics, data and analyses of trends by food group and region. commodity market trendscereal markets in 2020/21 are well supplied, with prices affected by tightening markets for wheat and robust international demand for coarse grains and rice, the report notes. fao updated its supply-and-demand forecasts for cereals last week. global production of oilseeds and derived products in 2020/21 is expected to reach a new record over the 2020/21 seasons, while growing demand points to tightening markets. world sugar production in 2020 is seen rebounding, although below the pace of growing consumption, which will depend on whether further covid-19-related lockdown measures are imposed. global meat production in 2020 is forecast to decline for the second year in a row, amid subdued trade and demand prospects. world milk production in 2020 is also predicted to expand, buoyed by favorable monsoons and the resilience of village cooperatives' networks in collecting milk amidst logistic hurdles in india, along with government stabilization assistance in the european union and the united states of america. for the fisheries sector, which as noted above suffered a large drop in trade flows, production is expected to decline in 2020 due to the pandemic's impact on demand, logistics, prices, labour and business planning. capture fishery output will likely decline slightly, while aquaculture production is expected to decline for the first time in many years. the report notes that the pandemic's impact on the market for fish - notably a drop in demand for fresh fish due to aversion to going to markets and restaurants - has triggered ""far-reaching changes"" likely to persist in the long term and support product innovation, shorter value chains and new distribution channels. tropical fruitsthe covid-19 pandemic has rattled the value chain for tropical fruits, especially the most perishable items, which require labor-intensive handling and rapid and often airborne transport and have relatively high costs. global trade in pineapples, mangos and papaya has declined, sometimes at a double-digit pace. tropical fruit producer margins are under pressure from pandemic disruptions as well as highly competitive value chains, the intensifying market power of downstream actors, the occurrence of plant diseases, and adverse weather events. ""it will be critical to develop policies aimed at providing financial support to producers so that they can remain operational, while protecting the health and safety of workers and minimizing disruptions to national and international transport routes,"" says sabine altendorf, fao economist and author of this chapter.bananas and avocados, by contrast, have showed some resilience, with both fruits posting export growth, but critical strains have affected their value chains, especially for smaller producers, who face elevated prices of fertilizer and pesticides and have suffered from cancelled orders. demand for bananas has benefited from their perceived sanitary safety, convenience and record supplies from ecuador, as well as an output recovery in costa rica.  avocado imports have also grown on a global basis, as seasonally lower supplies from mexico and an outright drop in purchases in the u.s. are more than offset by robust demand in the european union and significantly higher supplies from colombia, kenya and peru.",2021-04-16

is a rapidly growing industry with sales in china alone of usd 4.8 billion in 2018. the dumplings, with their unique taste and high nutritional value, are made of dough and can be filled with meat, seafood, eggs, nuts or vegetables. the regional standard will establish the specifications, processing procedures, hygiene and labelling requirements for the product to bring consistency across the region, improve product safety and quality and ensure a level playing field for trade. new work: regional standard for cooked rice wrapped in plant leaves adopted- 25.09.2020 this product, widely consumed under a variety of names in countries such as china, japan, malaysia, the philippines, thailand and viet nam, is made of glutinous or other rice as the main raw material: with or without adding ingredients such as beans, nuts, meat, poultry and eggs as filling. it is completely wrapped and moulded with various types of leaves and tied with cotton threads. after being steamed and cooked, the product may be vacuum packaged and quick frozen. a lack of a standard for these products can lead to obstacles in trade, therefore with production and sales on the increase, work to ensure uniformity in cooked rice products in the region is timely standard for kiwifruit adopted- 25.09.2020 worldwide kiwifruit production and trade is growing and becoming increasingly valuable. this standard defines quality for kiwifruit including minimum requirements, classifications, sizing and quality tolerances. the standard will be a reference point for kiwifruit and facilitate fair practices in trade. standard for fresh garlic adopted- 25.09.2020 fresh garlic is one of the most popular culinary species around the world. the standard defines three classes based on quality and presentation. for example, for class ii garlic, there should be no more than three cloves, or one fifth of the total number of cloves in a bulb missing: whereas for extra class and class i garlic, the cloves must be compact or reasonably compact.   standard for ware potatoes adopted- 25.09.2020 this standard defines the quality requirements for ware potatoes at the export-control stage after preparation and packaging. ware potato comes in different varieties, sizes and colour and production and trade are increasing worldwide. generally, size is the only criteria taken into consideration, therefore this standard will help enhance trade as it identifies common quality factors which can be harmonized across regions.  standard for yam adopted- 25.09.2020 yam originates from southeast asia and melanesia,and is exported to other regions such as the americas, africa, the rest of asia, and australia. yam as a tuber is sensitive to physiological and physical damage, bruising, and cold conditions. the standard establishes the basic quality requirements for yam and establishes a benchmark for marketing yam globally.  code of practice on food allergen management for food business operators adopted- 25.09.2020 this code provides guidance on allergen management in food production, including controls to prevent cross-contact where an allergen is inadvertently transferred from a food containing an allergen to a food that does not contain the allergen. its publication comes amidst growing concerns regarding the serious nature of food allergies and their health consequences, and the increasing complexity of the food supply chain. the code will facilitate a proactive approach to managing allergens in food production, rather than a reactive response once a food safety hazard has been identified. it supplements the newly adopted revised general principles of food hygiene and the ongoing work on allergen labelling by the codex committee on food labelling.   revision of the general principles of food hygiene  adopted- 25.09.2020 this code of practice provides a common ground for the control of food safety worldwide and forms the basis for all other codex hygiene texts and standards. the revision includes updates which will enable better application by food business operators, competent authorities and other stakeholders. the code also provides more guidance on the important health issue of allergens which complements the adoption of a new codex code of practice on allergen management. this revision helps countries maintain a continued safe supply of food at a time when the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to reinforce good hygiene practices.  new work: guidelines for the safe use and reuse of water in food production adopted- 25.09.2020 this work will develop guidelines for the safe sourcing, use and reuse of water that comes into direct or indirect contact with food throughout the food chain. it will address the concept of water that is fit for purpose - as opposed to water of potable or drinking water quality - by applying a risk-based approach. the new text will consider the use of water along the food chain in context and it is also a response to the impact of climate change and the need to re-use or recycle water. food business operators will benefit from practical guidance and tools to help them understand the risks and available interventions. the work should be completed in 2023.  regional standard for mixed zaatar adopted- 25.09.2020 this standard determines the requirements and characteristics for mixed zaatar,

""this partnership is a signal of our commitment to leave no one behind. cash in digitized form will open numerous doors for people engaged in small-scale agri-food activities and offer great benefits. it is a high road to resilience.""""fao's announcement today is a landmark for the agriculture sector in emerging economies. fao's visionary leadership means that millions of small-holder farmers will now get the assistance they need more quickly, safely and transparently. it also means those farmers - many of whom are women - will have access to a wider range of related services to improve their livelihoods"", said dr. ruth goodwin-groen, managing director of the better than cash alliance. ""we are delighted that fao is joining other member un agencies, including unhcr, unicef and wfp, in their bold commitment to responsible digitization of financial transfers to those most in need. this is even more important now as the covid-19 pandemic is increasing poverty and inequality.""under director-general qu's leadership, fao is taking big steps to embrace and produce digital solutions, as they are destined to affect every actor in the global agri-food systems and can be designed to offer opportunities to address the challenges of poverty, hunger, inequality and climate change. fao already uses mobile money transfers. one example is in somalia where its mobile money and livelihood assistance platform delivers cash directly to beneficiaries' cell phones, allowing farming families to purchase goods and services they need most in their local markets. recipients are registered with the use of biometric data, which is evolving into a voice-recognition system, making this a safer, cheaper and better targeted means of conveyance than physical delivery and distribution.joining the better than cash alliance represents a step change in scaling up such efforts on all levels, and participating in an exchange on best practices in a fast-moving sector.  the new partnership holds significant promise, as fao has already reached more than 19 million people in 58 countries with cash and voucher programmes. in 2019 alone, fao transferred almost $50 million - a bit under half in digital form - to 2.8 million beneficiaries in 29 countries.as fao's field activities - aiming to strengthen the resilience of rural livelihoods to shocks by supporting productive investment in agriculture - tend to engage vulnerable people living in rural dispersed and remote areas with limited infrastructure access, its digitalization experiences and needs will complement those of other alliance members.on the groundscaling up digitized financial transfers enables direct contact to beneficiaries, many of whom have no bank account, and avoids the need for physical cash distribution, which entailed transporting bank notes to hard-to-reach areas - especially amid conflicts or in the wake of natural disasters - and engaging agents to act as distributors. today, digital payment options continue to grow, accelerating our ability to reach the unbanked while mitigating financial risks.  building broader digital networks allows broader participation, thus intensifying the pace of adoption and transformation of local economies. ""cash injects value in local economies, and digital cash is likely to produce an even stronger effect through financial inclusion, by fostering greater access for the beneficiary to credits, loans and other financial instruments that have typically been scarce in rural economies and have curbed investment as a result,"" says étienne juvanon du vachat, from fao's office of emergencies and resilience specializing in cash and voucher design. ""a mobile wallet opens the door to more services."" compared with traditional rural finance systems reliant on trust and authority, e-money can bolster programmes aimed at fostering opportunities for women and youth. at the same time, it is quite adaptable to diverse existing community savings and loans institutions such as tontines or hawala, he added. fao's showcase project in somalia proved invaluable when the covid-19 emergency disrupted movement. since march 2020, fao has transferred the equivalent of $38.1 million to over 187 000 households, providing them the means to acquire food and agricultural inputs to support local food security and supply.in mozambique, in 2020, fao deployed an adapted version of the ecosystem initially developed in somalia to move an existing voucher system onto a 100-percent digital foundation. beneficiaries, in particular targeted women farmers, use the vouchers to access seeds and fertilizers.digitization adds incentives to suppliers to adapt to the technology, helping consolidate system-wide digital literacy and protect beneficiaries' personal identifiable information, which in turn can enhance factors of production and marketing opportunities for broader communities. the process can take time but adoption is rapid, and pandemic containment measures appear to have accelerated recognition of the merits of digitization.""the greatest challenge in this effort is successfully bridging the last mile connecting fao to the most vulnerable. there is no single widely accepted means of digital payments. however, we are on the cusp of significant change. complexity will diminish and as it does, impact will grow,"" says william marvin, deputy director of fao's finance division. as members pursue measures such as digitizing their social protection systems, synergies for fao will grow, he says. ""sometimes digital payments work better in the developing world as they are leaping a whole generation. there's lot of potential for leveraging partnerships between the private and public sectors,"" he adds.",2021-04-16

""we know that farmer education and community action are critical in best managing faw, and curbing its spread as much as possible,"" said maria helena semedo, fao deputy director-general. ""the guide builds on the experiences of farmers and researchers from the americas who have been dealing with the pest for centuries as well on new technology and lessons learnt so far in africa. it gives african farmers and frontline agricultural workers the practical advice they need to tackle faw head-on,"" added semedo.  fao also calls on those african countries likely to be affected soon, given the current distribution of faw in africa, to get prepared by: re-enforcing early warning systems at community level, raising awareness among farmers, and using available materials, such as the guide.  by early 2018, only 10 (mostly in the north of the continent) out of the 54 african states and territories have not reported infestations by the invasive pest. the guide on integrated management of the faw on maize up close ""as faw is new to africa, farmers' and crop protection and extension workers' good understanding of the pest's behavior and management practices are crucial in effectively managing it without damaging human health and the environment,"" said bukar tijani, fao assistant director-general and regional representative for africa.  key guidelines and advice on effectively and sustainably managing faw include:   visit the field and look at the status of the crop: its health and signs of presence of the faw. farmers can take direct action by crushing egg masses and young larvae. faw damage can look alarming, but maize plants have a good capacity to compensate for that damage and often little yield is lost. learn about faw behaviour. for example: understanding how and where the adult female moth lays her eggs can help determine where to plant mixed crops to prevent further spread of faw.  understand the important role of natural biological control in managing faw. studies have shown that faw suffers up to 56 percent mortality from parasitoids (beneficial insects such as tiny wasps killing eggs or larvae of the faw) alone.  farmers must be able to recognize the faw natural enemies and learn how to conserve and enhance them. ants have already shown to be important faw predators.  fields in nigeria have already shown high levels of natural faw mortality due to fungal and viral entomopathogens (pathogenic organisms killing faw larvae). farmers can recycle' these naturally-occurring pathogens. farmers can try ""local remedies"", including application of ash, lime, sand, or soil directly into infested whorls, already successfully used by some african farmers against faw. pesticides versus bio-pesticides: what should be used to fight faw?  the guide recommends that at a national policy level, information and recommendations regarding the role of pesticides in faw management are urgently needed. the guide warns that insecticide applications are costly, may not work because of resistance, poor application techniques, or low-quality pesticides, and will negatively affect faw's natural enemies.  although farmers may receive insecticides free this year, and maybe next, it is doubtful if they will still be receiving them in the longer-term. alternative and sustainable solutions must be found as faw is in africa to stay and will be infesting maize fields for many years.  the actions taken to date in most countries have been limited to the use of synthetic pesticides (especially organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids, a few neonicotinoids, and in some cases cocktails of pesticides). in some countries, the pesticide applications were mainly emergency responses, not based on a cost-benefit evaluation.  older pesticide molecules, recognized as hazardous and banned in industrialized countries, are often still readily available and widely used in african countries. these products put farmers' health and their environments at risk. their use may also result in pesticide residue levels that could jeopardize the marketability of crops both on domestic and export markets. bio-pesticides, including those based on bacteria, virus, and fungus have been tested, developed, registered and used successfully in the americas. the use of botanical and biological insecticides (certain strains of bacillus thuringiensis (bt), fungi and virus) to manage faw has been reported to be effective in several sources, but bio-pesticides are not always locally available in the affected countries. tackling faw  farmer field schools have been supported by fao for over twenty-five years and have proven an effective approach to reaching millions of smallholder farmers and successfully engage them in a learning process resulting in better management of their crops and natural resources. fao has been already rolling out training of trainers on how to manage faw for frontline crop protection and extension in countries most affected by faw. ""with this guide, fao will begin a continent-wide program of training master trainers to initiate an all-africa programme of farmer field schools for the sustainable management of faw. over the next five years, fao and partners aim to reach 10 million farmers through 40,000 farmer field schools across africa,"" said allan hruska, fao principal technical coordinator on fall armyworm.    work is also underway to launch a faw monitoring and early warning system (famews) app in madagascar, zambia, and south africa, and then gradually roll-it out across the continent. already tested, the fao app will enable farmers to send vital info about their crops' health, helping to generate detailed and reliable knowledge on faw infestation levels, faw adult population levels, and on the outcomes of actions taken against faw.  fao and its partners have been at the forefront in tackling faw, and continue to support prevention, early warning and effective response.in addition to the ffs guide and its roll-out across africa, fao took immediate steps as soon as faw was detected in africa by: bringing together experts to share knowledge and experiences on sustainable faw management; giving farmers and frontline agricultural workers the understanding, experience and confidence to tackle faw; supporting countries to mitigate pest damage, develop action plans, and train extension workers and farmers. fao also developed a framework for partnership for sustainable management of faw to provide guidance for the development of faw-related projects and programmes and ensure synergies and complementarities among the different development partners.",2021-04-16
