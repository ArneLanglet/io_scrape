ioc-unesco has been tasked by the un general assembly with coordinating its crucial 10-year global initiative to transform how we generate and use ocean knowledge for sustainable development.
this is one of the most important decades of the century. the ipcc special report on the ocean and cryosphere has revealed alarming trends and overwhelming evidence of the far-reaching consequences if the world does not come together and make choices for a healthier ocean which is critical for the future of the planet. from the equator to the poles, melting ice caps and rising sea levels, ocean warming, extreme weather events, ocean acidification and other processes are disrupting marine ecosystems and life on this planet as we know it.
“the covid-19 crisis must be the start of a global wake-up call. we must reforge our relationship with nature and the living world. we also need to reinvent our relationship with the oceans. it is this revolution that we wish to bring about with the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development which i am delighted to be launching as we begin 2021.”
audrey azoulay, director-general of unesco

despite the value and state of our oceans, ocean research so crucially important, is underfunded. the year 2021 begins a hopeful and ambitious super decade for the ocean: the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030), the “ocean decade”. this unique initiative will mobilize the global ocean community around a transformative research agenda that delivers much needed knowledge led solutions for achieving a healthy and sustainable ocean.
over the next ten years, a wide range of decade actions, driven by diverse partners around the world, will be implemented to meet ten decade challenges that represent the most pressing and immediate needs for ocean research, capacity development, and the infrastructure and tools needed to support generation and use of ocean knowledge to create better policy, develop innovative solutions for sustainable development, and incite behavior change.
the ultimate objective is to launch a revolution on how we generate and use ocean knowledge for the benefit of humankind while supporting the united nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development in achieving transformative change for people and the planet.
“the ocean decade will pull together great minds and resources. this is the right moment to reset and refocus to be sure we move forward in a more sustainable way and reestablish this incredibly important, yet fragile relationship we have with nature and our ocean.”
h.s.h. prince albert ii of monaco

‘a brave new ocean’ gave global leaders, philanthropists, heads of united nations agencies, sports personalities, leading scientists, and energetic young activists from every corner of the planet a chance to send an urgent message to the world about the critical role the ocean should play in shaping the future of the entire planet and pulling countries out of the current health and economic crisis.
“today, we launch the un decade on ocean science for sustainable development to begin an ocean science revolution that restores the ocean’s ability to nurture humanity for current and future generations. together, we will build ‘a brave new ocean’.”
h.e. antónio guterres, secretary general of the united nations.

the event, which featured a number of founding members of the ocean decade alliance including h.e. hon. uhuru kenyatta president of kenya, h.e. erna solberg prime minister of norway, h.r.h. princess lalla hasnaa of morocco and h.e. hon. marcelo rebelo de sousa of portugal, was a celebration of some exceptional achievements so far in identifying ways a healthy, resilient ocean can contribute to a blue post-pandemic recovery. philanthropic institutions, like the schmidt ocean institute and the bertarelli foundation, are some of the strongest ocean decade advocates. the schmidt ocean institute research vessel falkor has been collecting ocean data during a deep-sea mapping expedition off the coral sea marine park in australia’s great barrier reef to contribute to the nippon foundation-gebco seabed 2030 initiative. this ambitious initiative aims to completely map the global ocean floor by the year 2030.
“although we are focusing on the ocean today, the un sustainable development goals s ask us to make a connection between the land and the sea. i welcome this ocean decade as an extraordinary opportunity for the ocean community to come together and elevate our appreciation of everything the ocean provides for humanity and to stimulate greater effort to explore, discover and understand ocean systems.”
wendy schmidt, president and co-founder, the schmidt family foundation and co-founder, schmidt ocean institute, schmidt futures, 11th hour racing  

building a ‘a brave new ocean’ by 2030 will require a transdisciplinary approach that works across all sectors, geographies and disciplines in ocean science. this is why partnerships and collaboration will be at the heart of the ocean decade over the next ten years, including through engagement mechanisms like the global stakeholder forum which will be rolled out over the next months. national and regional committees and groups are also already emerging, as are courageous ocean champions like vendee globe race skippers alexia barrier and boris herrmann, and professional surfer maya gabeira, who are on the frontline of climate change and bear witness to the daily impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems.
“the oceans are fragile. i worry more and more when i see the changes. how much less fish and life i see, how i see corals changing colour and fishermen coming back with not much of a catch. i know we are responsible for this. we must communicate and let others know what is happening. this is our world. we all need and must care for the ocean.”
maya gabeira, big wave surfer, 2x world record holder and oceana ambassador

the ocean decade is more than pure science. it will include valuable knowledge which indigenous communities have to share, those who are often at the greatest risk and stand to lose the most if the world does not focus efforts on a sustainable, and above all, equitable blue recovery.
“science for understanding the earth, nature and oceans is not just about the graphs and data. it’s also about understanding the stories, human connection and emotions for why these places are so important. this is what we can learn from indigenous peoples, whether they be navigators, hunters or trackers.”
lehua kamalu, voyaging director, polynesian voyaging society

future generations, which also have a great stake in the future of our ocean, are already actively engaged in ocean decade efforts and showed up in force during “a brave new ocean” to send the world an important message.
“my advice during this decade of ocean science is that all ages must act. so, when an opportunity appears before you, grab it and take action!”

"2","United in Science report: Climate Change has not stopped for COVID-19




								Date: 10 September 2020","https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/united_in_science, https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/united_in_science, https://www.globalcarbonproject.org, https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/united-science-report-climate-change-has-not-stopped-covid19, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","this is according to a new multi-agency report from leading science organizations, united in science 2020. it highlights the increasing and irreversible impacts of climate change, which affects glaciers, oceans, nature, economies and human living conditions and is often felt through water-related hazards like drought or flooding. it also documents how covid-19 has impeded our ability to monitor these changes through the global observing system.
“this has been an unprecedented year for people and planet. the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted lives worldwide. at the same time, the heating of our planet and climate disruption has continued apace,” said un secretary-general antónio guterres in a foreword.
“never before has it been so clear that we need long-term, inclusive, clean transitions to tackle the climate crisis and achieve sustainable development. we must turn the recovery from the pandemic into a real opportunity to build a better future,” said mr guterres, who will present the report on 9 september. “we need science, solidarity and solutions.”
the united in science 2020 report, the second in a series, is coordinated by the world meteorological organization (wmo), with input from the global carbon project, the intergovernmental panel on climate change, the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco, the un environment programme and the uk met office. it presents the very latest scientific data and findings related to climate change to inform global policy and action.
“greenhouse gas concentrations - which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years - have continued to rise. meanwhile, large swathes of siberia have seen a prolonged and remarkable heatwave during the first half of 2020, which would have been very unlikely without anthropogenic climate change. and now 2016–2020 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record. this report shows that whilst many aspects of our lives have been disrupted in 2020, climate change has continued unabated,” said wmo secretary-general, professor petteri taalas.

highlights from the key findings
earth system observations during covid-19 (intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco and wmo)
the covid-19 pandemic has produced significant impacts on the global observing systems, which in turn have affected the quality of forecasts and other weather, climate and ocean-related services.
the reduction of aircraft-based observations by an average of 75% to 80% in march and april degraded the forecast skills of weather models. since june, there has been only a slight recovery. observations at manually operated weather stations, especially in africa and south america, have also been badly disrupted.
for hydrological observations like river discharge, the situation is similar to that of atmospheric in situ measurements. automated systems continue to deliver data whereas gauging stations that depend on manual reading are affected.
in march 2020, nearly all oceanographic research vessels were recalled to home ports. commercial ships have been unable to contribute vital ocean and weather observations, and ocean buoys and other systems could not be maintained. four full-depth ocean surveys of variables such as carbon, temperature, salinity, and water alkalinity, completed only once per decade, have been cancelled. surface carbon measurements from ships, which tell us about the evolution of greenhouse gases, also effectively ceased.
the impacts on climate change monitoring are long-term. they are likely to prevent or restrict measurement campaigns for the mass balance of glaciers or the thickness of permafrost, usually conducted at the end of the thawing period. the overall disruption of observations will introduce gaps in the historical time series of essential climate variables needed to monitor climate variability and change and associated impacts.
the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (intergovernmental panel on climate change)
human-induced climate change is affecting life-sustaining systems, from the top of the mountains to the depths of the oceans, leading to accelerating sea-level rise, with cascading effects for ecosystems and human security.
this increasingly challenges adaptation and integrated risk management responses.
ice sheets and glaciers worldwide have lost mass. between 1979 and 2018, arctic sea-ice extent has decreased for all months of the year. increasing wildfire and abrupt permafrost thaw, as well as changes in arctic and mountain hydrology, have altered the frequency and intensity of ecosystem disturbances.
the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system. since 1993 the rate of ocean warming, and thus heat uptake has more than doubled. marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency and have become longer-lasting, more intense and more extensive, resulting in large-scale coral bleaching events. the ocean has absorbed between 20% to 30% of total anthropogenic co2 emissions since the 1980s causing further ocean acidification.
since about 1950 many marine species have undergone shifts in geographical range and seasonal activities in response to ocean warming, sea-ice change and oxygen loss.
global mean sea-level is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing rates of ice loss from the greenland and antarctic ice sheets, as well as continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. the rate of global mean sea-level rise for 2006–2015 of 3.6 ±0.5 mm/yr is unprecedented over the last century.

"3","New Global Ocean Science Report voices concern over inadequacy of funding for ocean research




								Date: 14 December 2020","https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/, https://oceandecade.org/, https://en.unesco.org/gosr2017, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","paris, 14 december - lack of funding is hampering the development and implementation of marine research and its valuable applications, according to the second global ocean science report, published by unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc), ahead of the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030).

on average, states devote only 1.7% of their research budgets to sciences of the ocean (0.03% to 11.8%, depending on the country), much less than they spend on other major scientific fields. this is incomprehensible considering the fundamental role of the ocean in regulating the climate and its rich biodiversity.
moreover, discoveries in oceanography feed almost all sectors of the economy and society with applications in medicine, in the preservation of biodiversity, and in the development of new industrial processes. applications for climate change mitigation and adaptation account for the majority of patented oceanographic technologies.
“our knowledge of the ocean is a key element for the future of humanity,” said unesco director-general audrey azoulay. “the global ocean science report 2020 underlines the essential role of ocean research and international cooperation for all key issues of the 21st century.”

the number of ocean science publications is increasing in asia and, to a lesser extent, in north america and europe. the most advanced countries are china, japan and the republic of korea. budgets for ocean science vary considerably from country to country and over time. for example, between 2013 and 2017, 14 countries increased their average budget, with the russian federation recording the highest annual growth (over 10%), followed by the united kingdom and bulgaria, while nine countries reduced expenditure, in some cases significantly, japan, ecuador, turkey, brazil and italy among them.
moreover, while the international community committed to controlling the exploitation of ocean resources by 2030 in line with sustainable development goal 14 of the 2030 agenda, few have defined strategies to achieve this, the report points out.
the report highlights an increase in international collaboration among oceanographers and calls for the strengthening of south-south and north-south partnerships. innovation, complemented by technology transfer, must play a fundamental role in helping developing states achieve sustainable marine and fisheries resource exploitation.
in terms of human resources, the report also highlights the crucial need for training in the various areas of ocean management. it notes the under-representation of women, who account for 39% of all oceanographers, an increase compared to the previous report, and 6 points higher than the percentage of women in the natural sciences overall. this average nevertheless hides great disparities between countries, for example, women make up 63% of oceanographic researchers in croatia, compared to only 12% in japan.
world oceanography also needs to be rejuvenated, even if here again there are considerable national disparities. finally, the report indicates that states are not sufficiently equipped to manage their information, which hinders free access. the sharing of data, as a common good of humanity, should be among the priorities of the united nations decade for ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030, ""ocean decade"" for short), in relation to unesco’s work towards an international legal instrument on open science.
the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco considers that the next report, due to be published in 2025, should include an evaluation of the impact of covid-19 pandemic on the human and technical capacities of ocean science. it will also provide a mid-term review of the ocean decade.
ocean sciences encompass all research disciplines related to the study of the ocean: from physics and chemistry to the social sciences and humanities, biology, health, geology, hydrography, and more broadly all multidisciplinary research on the links between humanity and the ocean. the first global ocean science report was published in 2017.
the full report in english is available here. an executive summary of the report is available in all six un languages.

								Date: 12 March 2021","https://www.un.org/sg/en, https://unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2021/unisous419.html, https://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/sendai-framework, https://www.undrr.org/, https://www.un.org/en/events/tsunamiday/, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3Yhjpxzr1c, https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1086922, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","the un chief urged countries to make sure they invest the funds necessary to prevent and manage disasters, in a solemn message of remembrance on wednesday for the 18,400 people who died or are unaccounted for, due to the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan exactly ten years ago.
known officially as the great east japan earthquake and tsunami, antónio guterres expressed his condolences, “to those who continue to grieve the loss of loved ones: “ i think of those who remain displaced, unable to return to their homes because of safety concerns surrounding the destroyed fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant”.
he welcomed the findings of a un report published on tuesday, from the un scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation (unscear), which concluded that no adverse health affects among residents of fukushima had been found that could be directly attributed to radiation exposure.
mr. guterres noted that japan was “leading the world when it comes to disaster prevention” saying the country has invested heavily in building back safer in the past decade.
he described the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction, adopted six years ago, as a “global blueprint for a safer world”, and argued that to prevent and manage disasters more effectively, “countries need to plan, invest, give early warnings and provide education on what to do.""
‘never been so important’
“the whole notion of prevention and preparedness for a tsunami has never been so important,” said mami mizutori, un special representative for disaster risk reduction and head of the un office for disaster risk reduction (undrr), on wednesday.
in comments to mark the 10th anniversary, ms. mizutori told journalists in geneva that the disaster had taught harsh lessons about how to manage disaster risk.
the devastating surge on the northeastern coast of the island of honshu, led to the fukushima nuclear disaster.
in the last century, tsunamis have claimed more than a quarter of a million lives, killing on average, around 4,600 per event, over the course of  58 recorded instances, according to un figures.
'climate triggers'
but ms. mizutori warned that “disasters that are becoming much more rampant are all those related to climate emergency. and the number of climate emergency disasters have doubled during the past 20 years compared to the previous 20 years.”
unesco's intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) is “embarking on the very important developments in the tsunami warnings systems under a new campaign of the united nations,” said dr. vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of the ioc-unesco.
recently, the ioc carried out a tsunami-preparedness exercise with the countries bordering the northeast atlantic, the mediterranean and adjacent seas, to assess tsunami preparedness and coordination between communities and authorities. a similar exercise is planned for 12 march in the caribbean.
'tsunami ready'
“we hope very much that by the end of this decade 2030 we will have all tsunami- prone communities; tsunami-ready communities”, dr. ryabinin said. “they will know what is to be done, they will be equipped with the means to escape from tsunami and when (a) tsunami strikes, they will evacuate and save their lives.”
it was equally important for people to understand the role of science; to be ocean literate, climate literate and disaster risk reduction literate, the ioc spokesperson maintained.
highlighting the importance of education in ocean science in achieving progress in this area, dr. ryabinin added that “every facet of sustainable development, poverty, food, energy, climate and many other sustainable development goals, really if you think deeply, depend on ocean science.”

"5","COVID-19: The ocean, an ally against the virus




								Date: 17 April 2020","https://www.whoi.edu/news-insights/content/finding-answers-in-the-ocean/, https://quimamme.corriere.it/bambini/salute-bambino/covid-19-mare-alleato-contro-il-virus, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","bacteria, found in the depths of the ocean, are used to carry out rapid testing to detect the presence of covid-19. ""it is just one of the many prodigious uses of these organisms, which were discovered by some american microbiologists off the adriatic in 1986"", says francesca santoro, an oceanographer and researcher at the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco (ioc-unesco).
francesca santoro, ioc project office at the unesco regional bureau for science and culture in europe (venice, italy), interviewed by corriere della sera‘s quimamme, explained that the ocean is an ally in fighting the virus. not only does it help in the detection of covid-19 but to also combat it.
finding answers in the ocean
microbiologists from the woods hole oceanographic institute discovered the bacteria that underline this fundamental role for covid-19. the bacteria were identified years ago. it is also useful to diagnose aids and sars. the research, published in the journal of applied & environmental microbiology, continues to be of interest today as the ocean is a valid ally against the virus. the ocean is closely tied to human health.
our ocean and coasts affect us - even those of us who don't live near the shoreline. 
""the marine environment is very rich from the point of view of biodiversity and resources useful for humans’ daily life are still to be discovered,"" points out francesca santoro. the deep ocean has already given us compounds to treat cancer, inflammation, and nerve damage. breakthroughs have also come from the ocean depths in the form of diagnostic tools. 
many people think of the deep sea as a desert. to our naked eye, it looks like there is nothing there, but hydrothermal vents have a remarkable diversity of microbes, including genetic diversity and this is where this huge potential lies.
the environment protects and helps humankind
solutions to problems that threaten humankind come from the environment. therefore, humankind should strive, now more than ever, to protect the ocean, rather than suffocate it with waste and plastic. the “health” of the global ocean – the interconnected system of earth’s oceanic waters - is both affected by and a threat to human activities. while people have lived in harmony with the ocean for generations and have relied on its bounty, things have changed and the earth is now in great danger.
""year after year, the connection between human health and ocean health is even more evident. there is more and more research that uses substances produced by marine organisms as solutions to diseases such as cancer and alzheimer,"" reiterates francesca santoro. “for this reason, new generations and families ought to be at the forefront of the battle for the conservation of the ocean.”
robots hunt for ""miraculous"" resources
the way these discoveries are made is also fascinating. “species of robots (rov) controlled by an oceanographic ship are used for such scope; they make surveys and collect samples to study communities and understand what species there are,"" says francesca santoro.
“findings are however minimal and much is yet to be explored. only 3 people have so far descended into the mariana trench; james cameron, titanic’s film director, with a special vertical torpedo, is one of them. for an oceanographer, the moon is better known than the depth of the ocean.""
to enhance this type of investigation, the united nations has launched a decade of studies and insights into marine sciences.
the decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030) will provide a common framework to ensure that ocean science can fully support countries’ actions to sustainably manage the ocean and more specifically, achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. 
while this year’s negotiations on climate change, biodiversity and the global ocean were supposed to address the fortunes of a living world in a critical condition, the covid-19 pandemic is forcing drastic changes to the schedule. health is confirmed to be a priority for all; no exception.
promoting ocean literacy is among unesco's goals for the decade. this is another means to increase the awareness of all - adults and children alike - on the issues of protecting the ocean, so dear to us, which today is an ally against the virus and more generally a wealth to be enhanced also from the point of view of its biodiversity.
the diversity of species found in our ocean offers great promise for a treasure chest of pharmaceuticals and natural products to combat illness and improve our quality of life. ocean literacy plays an essential role in our future due to the importance for all of us to understand the importance of the ocean.

supported by the government of flanders, kingdom of belgium, and implemented by the iode project office of the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco (ioc-unesco), the oih project aims to improve access to global ocean information, data and knowledge products for sustainable development. it also focuses on fostering the discovery and interoperability of existing information systems through the development of the ocean data and information system (odis) architecture.
 as part of its key components, the oih project includes online resources implemented by ioc-unesco: oceanexpert, oceandocs/aquadocs, the ocean best practices system, the ocean biodiversity information system (obis), the world ocean database (wod) and ocean data portal (odp) – extended by partnerships with eurocean, marinetraining.eu, emodnet, and other sources in the odis catalogue of sources (odiscat). 
the project will benefit marine and coastal stakeholders across the globe, but its initial focus will be on responding to requests for data products and services from three regions: africa, latin america and the caribbean and the pacific small island developing states to meet their unique user community (thematic and language) requirements. the initial priorities for the project will be to develop communities of practice, as well as to formalize partnerships with other un agencies and international partners.
through these actions, the oih project will also enable a digital ecosystem where users, from any entry point, can discover content and services that they require, while also having opportunities to become content creators themselves.

the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development(2021-2030) gives us an opportunity to remind ourselves of these major challenges, and to share the innovative solutions that emerge. it is also intended to draw attention to the crucial role of research in improving our understanding of the ocean, and strengthening its resilience. provided that it is given the means to do so. according to the second global ocean science report 2020 published by unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc), member states spend an average of only 1.7 per cent of their research budgets on ocean sciences. 
by absorbing nearly a third of carbon dioxide emissions, oceans play a decisive role in regulating the climate. as a source of life, they are therefore crucial to the very fate of humanity. this is why oceans have long played a central role in international co-operation.
the establishment of the pacific tsunami warning and mitigation system (tws) in 1965, under the auspices of unesco, is a striking example of this. this system, which has served as a model for subsequent mechanisms set up in other regions of the world, has been a great success. it is proof that, in the face of major threats, the international community is able to transcend differences and work together for the common good. all the more reason to mobilize for the protection of oceans today.

"9","Ocean Observing System Report Card 2020




								Date: 20 October 2020","https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","the 2020 ocean observing system report card provides an update on the status of the global ocean observing system (goos), including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on ocean observations, the advances in observing measurements and initiatives, and the connection with vital services resulting from the observations.
motivated by the increasing importance of ocean knowledge for sustainable development as well as addressing climate-related trends, the report card highlights the value and need for sustained and integrated met-ocean observations, essential to predict the consequences of ocean and climate change, to design mitigation strategies and guide adaptation.
“we need to strengthen and fill the geographical and resource gaps in the global ocean observing system to meet the growing demand for weather and ocean services and forecast products, multi-hazard early warning systems, and climate and ocean health applications. there is also a need to support new technologies and the development of autonomous observing instruments”, says dr. anthony rea, director of infrastructure at the world meteorological organization.
in recognition of the fundamental importance of ocean observations to the success of the ocean decade, dr. albert fischer, head of ocean observations and services section at the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco, says, “one of the decade challenges is to ensure a sustainable ocean observing system that delivers timely data and information accessible to all users on the state of the ocean, across all ocean basins”.
in the current global covid-19 pandemic, several ocean observing systems and ocean monitoring operations have been impacted, as restrictions on research vessel operations hinders the repair and replacement of measuring equipment. 
months on from the initial pandemic impacts and with research vessel operations far from returning to normal, goos has growing concern for parts of the global system. the global pandemic has shown that international cooperation and operational flexibility, such as contracting commercial vessels and using ships of opportunity, are crucial to sustain and maintain the global ocean observation system at sea.
“as the global covid-19 pandemic took hold, some of the ocean observing networks were impacted in surprising ways highlighting both strengths and weaknesses in the global met-ocean observing system; the pandemic has also catalyzed creativity to maintain the in situ observations and may accelerate our use of autonomous instruments and new approaches in the future”, says dr. david legler, chair of the goos observations coordination group (ocg).
recently commercial shipping and private initiatives are getting more involved in cost effective and innovative met-ocean data collection projects, in support of ocean observations. “we need a future where commercial, research, and privately owned vessels make multivariate observations, using a combination of automated and human-observed measurements, and where all data and metadata will be available to benefit users of marine information” reports the report card.
the 2020 report card also highlights the latest remarkable advances in animal-based measurements; providing data in important regions that are currently poorly covered by traditional observing platforms, greatly enhancing studies of climate variability and the delivery of information for climate prediction at global and regional scales.
the ocean observing system report card was prepared by the goos observations coordination group together with oceanops.
new 5-year strategic plan for oceanops, the ocean observing system monitoring and coordination centre
the plan articulates five strategic goals, the objectives, and challenges to realize the vision for oceanops - to provide vital services in monitoring, coordinating, and integrating ocean data and metadata, across an expanding network of global oceanographic and marine meteorological observing and service communities in support of improved services and capabilities.
oceanops core functions are to monitor and improve the performance of the global ocean observing system, lead metadata harmonization, support and enhance operations, and enable new data streams. oceanops also addresses the strategic earth-system prediction goal of wmo by enhancing ocean data and metadata flow.
""on the strength of our experience, of our infrastructure built slowly and strategically, and following up a review process, we shaped a clear 5-year strategic plan, together with our stakeholders, to project our activities into the ocean decade. rebranded, with a new name that both preserves the jcomm observing programme support centre legacy and at the same time is a clearer expression of our role to the larger community, we are now rounding a new cape. we will keep focusing our eye (ops in greek mythology) on the goos and cultivate the integrated concept in all our actions"", says mathieu belbéoch, oceanops lead.

								Date: 23 June 2020","https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","on the 15th of march 2020, as it lay in the calm waters of cape town, the oceanographic research vessel ronald h. brown was about to be caught in the cross-hairs of the coronavirus outbreak. dr. leticia barbero of the university of miami, the vessel’s chief scientist, was notified by the captain of instructions to return to home port of norfolk, va, immediately. “it was a shock,” said dr barbero. “overnight, our vessel transformed from a research ship observing a decade’s worth of ocean changes, into a simple express steam home.”
amid the uncertainty of this unprecedented recall, the science team aboard the brown proactively prepared and deployed over fifty autonomous instruments, including ocean drifters and profiling floats, across the south atlantic and caribbean, to ensure that measurements vital to climate and weather prediction would continue to flow in their absence.
“three months later, it is clear that this quick action has helped maintain critical operations for two of the global ocean observing networks in the atlantic ocean,” says dr. emma heslop, programme specialist at the global ocean observing system (goos) secretariat. ""we need to act collectively if we want to maintain critical function and data flow for weather, climate and ocean health services on a global scale.”
dr. heslop is part of the team within the goos that conducted a survey to assess the impacts and forecast the pandemic’s risk to global ocean observations. she said that “the survey went out to the eleven global ocean observing networks of goos - each focused on different ways to observe the ocean”. this global ocean data is essential to developing reliable weather forecasts as well as to understand and predict climate change. a wide range of industries rely on a daily basis on these data, from farming to global shipping.
“the results of the survey and the issues uncovered are a key part of the learning and sharing processes between countries that we support,” said vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission, the un’s main ocean science body that also coordinates the goos. “this will allow us to pivot towards having leaders in ocean science engage in common priorities and cooperative action to sustain key observations and flows of data.”
around the world, as governments and oceanographic institutes recalled nearly all oceanographic research vessels to home port, the impact on our ability to observe the ocean has been dramatic. even where autonomous equipment such as moored buoys (fixed instruments that scan the whole “water column” from seafloor to the sea surface to provide a wide array of ocean data) or argo floats (free-drifting floats that provide information about ocean temperature, salinity, currents and biological properties) are used, maintaining the equipment in the absence of regular scientific missions is a challenge.

“there is a real risk that equipment will fail, resulting in the loss of both data and potentially the equipment itself, like the moorings,” explains dr. johannes karstensen, co-lead of the oceansites time-series network. the loss of even a single one of the over 300 operational moorings could mean a gap of two to five years of data. dr. karstensen said that “30-50% of moorings will be impacted by the pandemic, and some have already ceased to send data. considering that this equipment not only monitors vital information for the ocean economy but monitors long-term climate change, it is clear that maintenance missions need to be prioritized as an essential activity in the context of covid-19 regulations.” 
perhaps most strongly affected by the covid-19 pandemic were the observing operations within the “ships of opportunity programme”, which uses commercial and other non-scientific vessels to take vital ocean measurements. scientific ""ship riders"" normally deploy the observing instruments, but covid-19 restrictions mean that they can no longer operate aboard.
the slowdowns in deployment and maintenance of autonomous instruments, such as drifting buoys, drifting floats and underwater gliders, is equally challenging. though these instruments are more resilient, operating autonomously for months to years after being deployed by scientists, they need regular maintenance or redeployment, also impacted by pandemic restrictions. 
the system has shown resilience to the immediate impacts of pandemic-related shutdowns, as global observing networks were well-maintained going into the crisis and increasingly reliant on autonomous observing instruments. however, covid-19 restrictions have already reduced the level of deployments needed to maintain a sustained flow of weather and climate forecast data (see figure). without urgent international action to support ocean observing operations by the end of the year, we could see further significant disruptions with potentially devastating consequences.
within the last month a worrying 10% reduction in the flow of data from the argo network has been detected. “it is too early to tell to what extent this is due to covid-19” says mr. belbeoch, leader of the observing system monitoring unit jcommops, “however the very low level of recent argo float deployment compounds the situation, and this drop in data flow cannot be immediately remedied.”

“the weather forecasting systems will run off the rails if they don’t have the surface pressure information over the ocean to constrain them” said lars peter riishojgaard, director of the earth system branch at the world meteorological organization (wmo). “we cannot do reliable forecasting without this piece of information coming straight from the ocean via these drifting buoys.”
even as countries start to ease quarantine and confinement restrictions, ocean science may not necessarily be at the top of decision-makers’ priorities. among countries planning to restart research vessel operations in july (australia, finland, belgium, netherlands, new zealand, germany and us), important restrictions will still apply - such as the requirement that vessels leave and return through the same home port - which largely diminishes the area covered by research vessels.
there is a real concern that research vessel operations in some regions may not resume at all in the coming months, with impacts extended to the end of 2020 and possibly into 2021, when also considering related impacts on the supply chains for some of the observing instruments.
“despite its significant impacts on the ocean observing system, the covid-19 crisis can also be an opportunity for us to look at how to build greater resilience into our system,” argues dr. toste tanhua, co-chair of the global ocean observing system. “the impacts of covid-19 have brought to light the inter-reliance of systems and some clear weak points that we can now work on to increase system efficiency and robustness.”
“the covid-19 pandemic has also shown us the importance of developing pathways from science into societal solutions,” highlighted ioc’s executive secretary, dr. ryabinin. “that is true for ocean science as much as for health science, and even now ioc has been solidifying plans for a un decade of ocean science for sustainable development 2021-2030, that will harness research and develop transformative ocean science solutions, connecting people and the ocean.”
partnerships across political borders and operational flexibility may be what it takes to carefully organize the various actors undertaking ocean observations in the face of ongoing disruptions. moreover, international agreement to classify global ocean observing operations as essential activities could ensure that the global observing system better delivers critical information to weather forecast, warning systems, climate and ocean health applications into the future.

in this framework, fisheries and oceans canada, the canadian commission for unesco, l’oréal canada and the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco teamed up to organize a dedicated virtual dialogue: ‘making waves for ocean science: empowering women leaders in the ocean decade’ which aimed to draw the public’s attention to the importance of fostering gender-sensitive actions in ocean science and leverage the opportunities the ocean decade offers. the event gathered  ~ 400 participants from 82 different countries.  
despite ongoing efforts to encourage girls and women to pursue career in marine science, they continue to be under represented, particularly in the highly technical and decision-making categories. according to the 2nd global ocean science report (gosr2020) data, only 39 per cent of scientific ocean researchers worldwide are women. however, in countries such as angola, bulgaria, croatia, el salvador, ireland, poland and turkey, women comprise less than 50% of ocean science personnel, an encouraging figure that should be built upon.
the online dialogue promoted the role of women in ocean science leadership through the testimonies of inspiring leaders who raised a series of challenges to be addressed, building on their personal experience and shared examples of actions to ensure women in ocean science are supported and empowered, including:
the importance to mentor women early career ocean professionals;
the need to include women and non-binary individuals in the co-creation of ocean science management plans;
the need to actively support actions to empower more women and those who identify as non-binary to take on leadership roles;
the recognition that it is also an individual responsibility to take ownership of its own leadership path and show up for opportunities.
specific initiatives dedicated to advancing gender equity were also recognized, such as the international hydrographic organization ‘empowering women in hydrography’ program and the ‘commonwealth priorities for gender equality 2017-2020 and beyond’ paper which encourages cooperation to protect girls’ and women’s rights to education. they support the ocean decade objectives and align with the principles of diversity and inclusion.
""though more women study oceanography, their participation in higher education does not translate to equity in management, governance and decision making in the same field. the decade calls on governments and all relevant stakeholders to increase women’s access to and retention in ocean science."" asserted vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of ioc-unesco.

over the next ten years, the decade will aim at systematically identifying and dismantling barriers to achieving gender and generational balance so that no one is left behind. building on the discussions and outcomes of this session, a short outcome document will soon be available to highlight actions to empower women in ocean science at individual, organizational and governmental levels.
everyone should be able to participate and grow in, as well as contribute to ocean science: allowing women and girls to choose the challenge of ocean science will be a key priority of the decade.

								Date: 4 February 2021","https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","a new era of sailing for science is beginning with  imoca skippers during the vendée globe supporting the global ocean observing system, within the framework of the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030), and under the leadership of oceanops.
if it was not already enough to race across all the world's oceans, braving equipment failure and stormy conditions, these brave vendée globe skippers have also been taking vital ocean observations, proof of their engagement for the ocean!
“the vendée globe is a race that i would like to win, but the challenge we have to overcome is the one that will allow us to find solutions to climate change. we cannot stress enough the importance of the oceans, without them there would be no life on earth. as major players in our climate system, they store over 90% of the excess heat from radiative forcing and absorb about a quarter of the human-produced co2 emitted annually. this is why we are continuing our ocean research mission to protect this incredible wilderness”, says boris herrmann, team malizia/imoca skipper during the race.
despite the extra weight and the responsibility for observing equipment, this link-up between the global ocean observing system (goos) and ten of the imoca skippers in the vendée globe race has been wildly successful. these observations are from some of the least-visited regions of our global ocean - this is what makes the race so exciting, and also the data so valuable.
“i have deployed a profiler float leaving the pot-au-noir, a shipping route which is usually sparsely navigated. though the float weighs 20 kg and keeping extra weight to a minimum is crucial for the race, it is worthwhile. this is my choice. the future of the planet is seriously in danger”, says louis burton, bureau vallée 2/imoca skipper.  
thanks to oceanops (a ioc/unesco and wmo joint centre supporting goos), who internationally coordinates and monitors the sustained in situ components of the global observing system, 7 meteorological buoys and 3 profiling floats, operated respectively by météo-france and argo france, were deployed by the imoca skippers at agreed positions in the atlantic ocean. four skippers also carried onboard equipment to measure essential ocean variables such as sea surface salinity, temperature, co2, and atmospheric pressure, as well as measuring the microplastics pollution at sea. the data collected by these sampling efforts during the vendée globe were shared in real time in an international open-source database.
“the ocean is our playground, it is our working environment. over the years, i have seen the ocean changing in various ways. as a child, i have experienced the ocean in my home town of kamakura that was polluted with heavy oil. we would go in the ocean to swim and sometimes come back with lots of heavy oil all over our body. this was a very serious problem that the japanese government worked on very hard to make the oceans clean. since then, the ocean in japan has become very clean but there is now a bigger problem. a problem that we cannot see directly because it is so small. this problem is called micro-plastic. looking at the water, we feel the water being very clean but in fact it could be polluted. the problem is very serious and we need to find better solutions to counter this. the ocean is the lungs of the planet earth. we need to treat it better to be able to live a better life”, says kojiro shiraish, dmg mori/imoca skipper.

“we are several vendée globe sailors to have boats equipped with sensors and to collect oceanic data that we will transmit daily to scientists. considering the number of days we spend on the water and the remote places we travel through on a round-the-world trip, we provide a legitimate source of information”, says alexia barrier, 4myplanet/imoca skipper, who deployed an argo float near the kerguelen islands.
alexia, boris and luis are also involved in educational programs for students to raise awareness about the oceans with children. before the race, emanuela rusciano, oceanographer and coordinator of communication at oceanops, and maud tournery, scientific mediator at ifremer, met 3 classrooms in brest and plouzané, france, for a special session on ocean observations. during the session, students explored an argo float and how it helps scientists studying global warming, collecting data inaccessible to satellites, right down to the ocean’s depths. after the instrument’s deployment, educators and students will follow the trajectory of the float they have signed, and access resources about the data acquired from the adopt-a-float program portal.
the deployment of ocean observing instruments at sea is fundamental for the continuous measurement of oceanographic and atmospheric parameters of the ocean. observations are crucial for delivering marine weather and ocean services to support safety of life and property at sea, maritime commerce and the well-being of coastal communities. observations also provide insights into the global weather and climate system and the impacts of long-term climate change, as well information on the increasing stress on the ocean from human activities.
“observations from racing yachts, especially those acquired in remote areas of the ocean, are going to be vital for gaining a more complete knowledge of the ocean and the atmosphere above it, and for a more effective prediction of how the ocean may change in coming years”, says albert fischer director, goos project office at the intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) of unesco.
“for 10 years now, i have been pledging for the ocean sustainability and protection, and i have been trying to help scientists to better understand the ocean. i have realized that, due to the long period i spent at sea, in very remote oceanic areas, where only a few ships go, i can be really useful for ocean study and preservation. the oceanographic data i have acquired during this vendée globe are very rare and precious for the scientists,” says alexia barrier.
“the global ocean observing system is under growing pressure to meet the demand for weather and ocean services and forecast products, multi-hazard early warning systems, and climate and ocean health applications,” says wmo director of infrastructure anthony rea. “the current global covid-19 pandemic has impacted ocean observing systems and ocean monitoring operations. wmo therefore extends its appreciation and congratulations to the vendée globe skippers for their valuable contribution to weather and ocean observations and for sailing for science.”
martin kramp, the ship coordinator at oceanops, says the vendée globe skippers have made an important contribution both to weather forecasts and understanding the health of the ocean. “these instruments help us in areas where we have little means to gather met-ocean data. observations, such as the atmospheric pressure data acquired by the drifting buoys and transmitted in real-time to the operational centres, help to improve weather forecasting and protect safety of lives at sea, while the high-quality temperature data from profiling floats will enable scientists, throughout the world, to significantly improve the estimates of ocean heat storage” he says. 
in the long run, “we would like the carrying of weather and sea water instrumentation to be part of the imoca class rules for ocean races, so that every skipper, whether racing for the podium or not, takes part to the observation and preservation of the ocean”, kramp says. 
“as a skipper, i am very aware of the importance of protecting the environment and particularly the oceans. in my opinion, france has a particular responsibility because it governs the second largest maritime space in the world, this includes the maritime areas of its overseas departments and territories. the sustainable development initiatives of the imoca class make it possible to take ownership of targeted actions and become a real ambassador of the program”, says manu cousin.
the science initiative carried out during the vendée globe supports a goos made up of many thousands of buoys, profiling floats, underwater robots, ship-based sensors and marine mammals, supplying scientists and marine and weather forecasters with essential data about the conditions at sea for climate studies, forecasts and early warnings, and ocean health monitoring.
“about 2,000 autonomous instruments (such as profiling floats and drifting buoys) must be deployed every year to sustain the goos. we are calling today, through a specific un ocean decade project, on civil society to support the goos implementation and we wish to unlock the potential of the citizens, ngos, private sphere and of the world class sailors and mariners, some of our best ocean ambassadors”, says mathieu belbéoch, oceanops lead.

the un ocean decade is a unique opportunity to change the way we care about the ocean and effectively support ocean science and oceanography for its protection and sustainable development. the decade is the chance we all have to contribute actively towards putting in place a more sustainable and complete ocean observing system that delivers timely data and information accessible to all users on the state of the ocean across all basins.
the involvement of the imoca skippers in this science project is part of a partnership that was signed in january 2020 between unesco and imoca to support ocean science and protection of the ocean. for 2 years, these organisations will carry out various joint projects including met-ocean observations.
the important vendée globe/imoca science project is part of a growing global awareness in the racing community of the necessity to take action to preserve the ocean, as well as the result of a resilient work carried out, since several years, by oceanops to team up with “sailing ships of opportunity” to gather meteorological data and deploy oceanographic instruments at sea. this project follows similar initiatives by sailors coordinated by oceanops in the volvo ocean race (and this will again be the case on the ocean race 2022-23), the barcelona world race, the clipper race, the rallies organized by jimmy cornell and the recent imoca-organised arctique-les sables d’olonne race.
“our skippers benefit from a unique experience. they navigate in the most isolated places on the globe and are the first to witnesses the impact of human activity on the oceans. the imoca class is aware of the urgent need to protect and preserve our seas, which makes the partnership with oceanops and unesco's ioc even more valuable. in the next imoca cycle (2021-2024), we want to go further in involving more teams in the scientific contribution process”, says antoine mermod imoca director.
“on behalf of the ocean observing community, i wish to congratulate and thank all imoca skippers for their commitment to the ocean protection and their invaluable contribution to weather and ocean observations”, says belbéoch.

""at the beginning of the third millennium, oceanography has the capacity to identify problems and offer solutions, provided we stop neglecting its contribution. as the world adapts to a new normalcy with the emergence of the coronavirus, ocean sciences will play an important role in post-pandemic recovery efforts."" audrey azoulay, director-general of unesco

although oceanographic research is one of the most promising areas of applied science, states on average only spend 1.7% of their research budgets on ocean sciences, much less than on other areas scientific areas of research, according to the global ocean science report, published by unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) on 14 december. this is all the more difficult to justify given that the contribution of the sea to the world economy was estimated at us$1.5 trillion in 2010 by the oecd, a figure that is far from negligible and probably underestimated. in the same year, the maritime economy provided full time employment to than 30 million direct full-time jobs.
fishing represents the ocean’s largest contribution to the global economy: the ocean provides a livelihood for more than three billion people. the seas also play an essential role in a wide range of economic activities: trade, energy transport, tourism, fossil fuels, oil and gas, and, increasingly, renewable energies with the development of offshore wind power. human health, safety and well-being depend on the health and knowledge of the ocean as a whole. this work is carried out by unesco which notably coordinates tsunami early warning systems and ocean education to combat the plastic pollution of the planet's blue lung.
better knowledge of the ocean, which covers 71% of the planet, could contribute even more to development. to date, only about 20% of the seabed is mapped in high resolution. there are vast areas yet to be studied, notably the arctic regions about which little, of its distribution of species, ecosystems and ocean processes. at a time when the ocean’s capacity to mitigate global warming is stretched to the limit, a better understanding of ocean phenomena appears to be indispensable.
the united nations general assembly has endorsed seven outcomes for the decade of ocean science for sustainable development leading to 2030:
a clean ocean where sources of pollution are identified and reduced or removed,
a healthy and resilient ocean where marine ecosystems are understood, protected, restored and managed,
a productive ocean supporting sustainable food supply and a sustainable ocean economy,
a predicted ocean where society understands and can respond to changing ocean conditions,
a safe ocean where life and livelihoods are protected from ocean-related hazards,
an accessible ocean with open and equitable access to data, information and technology and innovation,
an inspiring and engaging ocean where society understands and values the ocean in relation to human wellbeing and sustainable development.
the implementation plan for the decade was developed through an inclusive of process consultations involving all ocean regions and approved by the general assembly of the un.
in the words of the executive secretary of unesco-ioc, vladimir ryabinin, “we need to revolutionize the way we use ocean science. the decade creates the conditions for this qualitative transition by bringing about a paradigm shift in the production of ocean knowledge to guide the development of more sustainable solutions for the planet.”

the international community committed to achieving the sustainable use of the ocean by 2030 when it subscribed to sustainable development goal 14.

								Date: 22 June 2020","https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373623, https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373623_fre, https://oceandecade.org/, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","based on the outcomes of the technical workshop organized on 5-7 november 2019 in libreville (gabon) with the support of the gabonese republic and government offices of sweden, the ioc’s technical report on the status of coastal vulnerability in central african countries provides an overview of the region’s adaptive capacity through an analytical, ecosystem-based and people-centered methodology and proposes six pathways for resilience to tackle coastal vulnerability in the seven countries studied*.
taking stock of the status of coastal vulnerability in central africa
because of the unique location of the coastal zone as the transitional zone between land and the marine environment, populations – who rely directly or indirectly on its resources and services for livelihood and stable economy – have consistently concentrated in this region.
the central african coastal belt houses highly crucial economic sectors like fisheries, tourism, agriculture, energy and maritime transport that are threatened by erosion, flooding, pollution, sea level rise and urban development, among others. with the expected increase of coastal hazards and risks due to socio-economic stressors and climate variability, and if no resilience strategies are implemented, the region’s coastal communities will potentially suffer great impacts and costs.
in this spirit, for coastal ecosystems and people to be resilient to threats – whether natural or human-induced – the report argues that complex decision-making is required, one that not only takes into account the impact of climate change but also factors in future population expansion, industrialization, urbanization, technological advancement, consumption pattern, behavioral change, culture, values and tradition.
various regional, supra-regional and international policy and legal instruments already recognize the need for an integrated and sustainable management of the african continent’s coastal zone, whose benefits also extend to landlocked states. as such, the report considers that challenges can only be faced sustainably if the broad range of national and sectoral policies and the implementation of existing legislations are brought under the same umbrella.
pathways for resilience
to explore the ambitious actions and transformational systems needed to adapt to human and climate pressure, six strategic pathways at the intersection of society, environment and economy were identified to assist the seven countries of the region:
build power, foster expert networks, build capacity, increase community voice and promote information sharing
craft a comprehensive strategy that is capable of “walking/working” the talks for climate resilience
adapt the economy to the new climate reality
advance the climate resilience legal and policy agenda
strengthen regionalism and bioregional identity
align and expand scientific/technical infrastructure building in support of decision making
applied to sustainable development, these “resilience pathways” aim to provide a hands-on guidance in favor of 1) broadened policy processes through participatory deliberation and negotiation, and 2) the creation of long-term mechanisms for delivering a climate resilient future through cross-border cooperation and a central african regional approach to coastal resource management.
the report concludes that ecosystem-based management policy instruments such as integrated coastal zone management (iczm) or marine spatial planning (msp) can contribute to the implementation of the recommended pathways, as they have the potential to coordinate a diverse range of stakeholders across sectors and levels of governance at local, national and regional scale.
the french version of the technical report on the status of coastal vulnerability in central african countries is also available here.
the technical workshop in libreville (gabon) and technical report are contributions from africa and by african experts to the ioc-unesco/european commission joint roadmap to accelerate msp processes worldwide and preparatory process of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030). they also support the implementation of targets within the sustainable development goal 14 of the 2030 agenda.

the high level panel for a sustainable ocean economy (the ‘ocean panel’) was established in 2018 by 14 world leaders. the ocean panel seeks to change the way the world thinks, acts and feels about the ocean, and inspire policies and actions at the highest levels to catalyse the transition to a sustainable ocean economy. in this spirit, over the last several years the ocean panel commissioned a number of peer-reviewed blue papers and special reports to explore priority ocean issues that have significant policy relevance. this assessment informed the ocean panel’s action agenda ‘transformations for a sustainable ocean economy’ which has a headline commitment to sustainably manage 100% of the ocean by focusing on five key pillars: ocean wealth, ocean health, ocean equity, ocean knowledge and ocean finance.
the vision of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030) (‘the ocean decade’) is ‘the science we need for the ocean we want’. the ocean decade – which started on 1 january 2021 - provides a convening framework for scientists and stakeholders from diverse sectors to develop the scientific knowledge and the partnerships needed to accelerate and harness advances in ocean science to achieve a better understanding of the ocean system and deliver science-based solutions to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. the un general assembly mandated unesco's intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc - unesco) to coordinate the preparations and implementation of the decade.
leveraging synergies between the ocean panel and ocean decade
a recent analysis prepared by ioc-unesco entitled ‘ocean knowledge for a sustainable ocean economy: synergies between the ocean decade and the outcomes of the ocean panel’, and supported by the government of portugal, documents the synergies between the ocean panel and the ocean decade. it illustrates the inextricable role that the ocean decade will have in contributing to the ambition of the ocean panel and identifies areas where mutual efforts can be aligned to develop a lean, reliable guiding framework for ocean action to achieve the ocean we want – and need – by 2030.
the analysis provides a clear picture of the many different interactions that exist between the ocean panel’s five pillars of a sustainable ocean economy and the ten ocean decade challenges representing the most immediate and pressing needs of the decade. proposals for action are presented so that stakeholders and partners of the ocean panel and ocean decade can optimize collaborative efforts and respond to emerging demands for robust ocean knowledge relevant to society and necessary for achieving a sustainable ocean economy.

the training workshop addressed young researchers (postgraduate and postdoctoral students) from countries in the region (cabo verde, gambia, guinea, mauritania, morocco, senegal, and spain), whose research focuses on the physical, biochemical or ecological processes of the canary current eastern boundary upwelling system, with the aim to improve the capacities of a new generation of regional researchers through ad hoc scientific training and peer interaction
in his opening speech, paulo lima veiga, minister of maritime economy of cabo verde said that cabo verde – a small island developing state with specific limitations imposed by its small size and insularity – faces enormous challenges and is especially concerned by the harmful consequences of climate change, which include serious, negative economic, social and environmental impacts, such as threats to food security, which continue to undermine sustainable development.
“the fact that cabo verde is 99% sea, and has a privileged geographical position, highlights its obligation to adopt a collaborative approach with regard to the sustainable use of marine resources within its area of <U+200B><U+200B>jurisdiction”, affirmed the minister.

on 30 october 2020, at 13.51 local time (11.51 utc), an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 mw struck off the aegean coast of turkey, south of izmir, and north of the greek island of samos (37.91 n 26.79 e), with an estimated hypocentral depth of 21 km (usgs-united states geological survey). the earthquake triggered a tsunami that flooded the coastal district of seferihisar (turkey) and the port of samos (greece).
within 8-11 minutes after the detection of the earthquake, tsunami bulletins were issued to national focal points by the tsunami service providers (tsps) accredited by unesco’s ioc intergovernmental coordination group for the tsunami early warning and mitigation system in the north-eastern atlantic, the mediterranean and connected seas (icg/neamtws)*. greece and turkey were put on “tsunami watch” (highest level of alert), while other countries either on “tsunami advisory” and/or “tsunami information” levels.
according to the institute of geodynamics-national observatory of athens and the kandilli observatory and earthquake research institute of turkey, eyewitnesses in certain locations claimed that the drawback started within 2-5 minutes after the earthquake, followed by runup within 15-20 minutes after the earthquake. preliminary rapid assessments show that a runup of 1.8 meters on the northern side of samos (karlovasi and vathy), with a maximum flow depth values of 1.9 meters and 1.5 meters in akarca and sigacik, respectively.
as part of the emergency response, text messages to cellphones were sent by the general secretariat for civil protection in greece 24 minutes after the earthquake and preliminary data show that local authorities (police and port authority) in vathy ordered people to move away from the coast. reports indicate that self-organized evacuation took place among the population living in the impacted areas in greece and turkey, leading to zero casualties in greece. according to the turkey's disaster and emergency management authority (afad), one of the confirmed victims of the disaster in turkey drowned because of the tsunami.
science contribution to preparedness 
the event shed light one more time on the need to strengthen tsunami preparedness in the region, through enhanced sea-level detection networks, education, as well as international cooperation. one of the main priorities is to increase the awareness of communities at risk and local authorities through communication, evacuation exercises, training, information, preparedness and recognition programmes such as the tsunami ready and the last mile programs, as it is the case for the pacific, caribbean and indian ocean region. people need to know what to do in the presence of natural signs (e.g. earthquake followed by rapid sea-level changes), with or without an official warning. 
international cooperation
on 12 june 2017 and 20 july 2017, two small-scale tsunami events occurred in the aegean sea (mw 6.3 and mw 6.9, respectively), the former impacting the island of lesvos (greece) and the latter impacting the island of kos (greece) and the bodrum region in turkey, within a few minutes after the earthquakes. as no timely alert reached the population, the community remained in the hazard area, exposed to a high risk.
after these two events, in 2018 a “tsunami last mile” project was initiated and funded by the european union’s emergency response coordination center (ercc), through the joint research center (jrc) to test technologies and procedures to effectively alert local communities in case of near-field tsunamigenic earthquake events. in kos, a tsunami preparedness exercise was conducted in november 2019, while bodrum carried out a tabletop exercise involving meetings with stakeholders on tsunami readiness.
on 30 october, one low-cost experimental device for sea level measurement (idsl) installed thanks to the tsunami last mile project picked up the tsunami signal (4-5 cm) in kos (greece), which supported, among other stations in the area, the confirmation that a tsunami had been generated.
following this last event, a field survey along the aegean coast of turkey has started under the leadership of prof. ahmet cevdet yalciner of the middle east technical university (metu) and with the support of kocaeli university (field), koeri and ec/jrc (remote). the team works in coordination with the national observatory of athens (noa) that has conducted a preliminary field survey on the island of samos and will survey all the greek islands around the earthquake epicenter.

unesco’s world heritage list includes the world’s most iconic marine protected areas, recognized by the international community for their outstanding biodiversity, beauty, geology and natural habitats. 
this report is a first assessment of blue carbon assets across the unesco marine world heritage sites, revealing their outsized role as custodians of globally relevant blue carbon resources, including the largest areas of seagrass and mangroves in the ocean. despite representing less than 1% of the global ocean area, marine world heritage sites and their immediate surrounding areas for which data was available comprise at least 21% of the global area of blue carbon ecosystems and 15% of global blue carbon assets. these carbon stores are equivalent to about 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2018.
investing in the conservation and restoration of unesco marine world heritage sites offers significant opportunities to mitigate climate change, meet the goals of the paris agreement under the united nations framework convention on climate change by including these assets in nationally determined contributions, and finance conservation, at least in part, through the resulting carbon credits. 
the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development and united nations decade of ecosystem restoration offer a unique opportunity to promote the restoration of these crucial habitats and accelerate reaching the united nations sustainable development goals by 2030.

								Date: 6 November 2020","https://oceandecade.org/, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","korea, sweden and canada renewed their support to the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030). piloted by unesco, the ocean decade is a unique opportunity to strengthen the management of the ocean: we are now entering the last step of its preparatory phase.
the republic of korea’s institute of ocean science and technology (kiost), the government of sweden, and the government of canada – led by fisheries and oceans canada (dfo), all announced new agreements with unesco’s ioc within the framework of the ocean decade to help promote the importance of ocean science to meet the sustainable development goals and to support the coordination of the ocean decade.
republic of korea’s institute of ocean science and technology (kiost): an agreement to create capacity-development opportunities
since 2018, kiost has contributed to the development of the decade’s strategy. their support has, among other things, made it possible for ioc to conceive the first communication materials of the decade and its societal outcomes, including the production of movies (e.g. executive planning group meeting), the organization of regional media trainings and the creation of a dedicated communication team.
this year, kiost has awarded additional funding to the ocean decade, upscaling a previous contribution awarded in 2018. this new contribution will enable unesco’s ioc to develop online events, a range of dedicated communication materials - such as new videos, brochures, printing documents – and the development of a strategic plan to include early careers ocean professionals (ecops) in activities and projects dedicated to the promoting of science as a lever of action to build sustainable societies.
as part of the implementation plan of the decade, the integration of small island developing states (sids) and least developed countries (ldcs) is a top priority during the preparatory phase of the decade: kiost funds will contribute to meet this goal.
the government of sweden: a cooperation to carry the implementation of the ocean literacy 
last year, the government of sweden enabled ioc to ensure regional and sub-regional synergies in support to the decade, to build collective capacities on marine spatial planning (msp) and sustainable blue economy, as well as to increase collective knowledge and information about the ocean. promoting international collaboration, sweden especially made possible the participation of african experts in the regional south atlantic planning workshop (brazil).
the swedish funds were allocated to advance cooperation around education and culture allowing the translation of the decade brochure and the establishment of ocean literacy trainings. sweden also financed the production of ocean literacy principles movies, featuring international ocean experts like sylvia earle or peter thomson.
this year, new funds will help to encourage the implementation of new trainings; the creation of proposed ocean literacy policies and innovative partnerships.
government of canada (fisheries and oceans canada): a partnership to support the decade’s coordination 
the government of canada has been committed to supporting the preparatory phase of the ocean decade over the last two years, including by leading the organization of the north atlantic regional consultation, and a financial contribution to the development of the implementation plan.
the new agreement will support the implementation of the decade’s strategic programme. over a four-year period (2020-2024), the government of canada’s funding will help establish the coordination, governance and engagement mechanisms for the decade. this financial investment will support the launch of a new online platform that will provide news and updates on the decade; the operations of the decade advisory board; and key engagement and outreach activities to promote the objectives of the decade. in addition to workshops already completed, planning is already underway to co-host various events to help advance gender equality in ocean science and support sustainable development through inclusive, co-designed, inter-disciplinary approaches.
launching the ocean decade
these three new strategic agreements will bolster ocean decade communications and outreach activities. by promoting regional and sub-regional synergies throughout virtual sessions; ensuring a sound governance and coordination of the implementation plan and developing a new guidance on coastal risks mitigation, the funds will help to ensure a successful launch of the decade well into its first year and beyond.",2021-04-16

as our ocean spaces become increasingly busy and a changing climate alters ocean conditions, msp has been recognized as an important planning framework to foster an environmentally sound development of ocean-based activities.
built on the contributions of international experts, the new mspglobal policy briefs help to understand why the increasing range and intensity of uses (recreation and tourism, shipping, fishing, wind farms, etc.) in marine and coastal waters – including the land-sea interface – require integrated, adaptive and climate-smart msp approaches.
the documents provide concrete examples and recommendations on how to achieve a sustainable governance of the ocean through multiple economic, ecological and social objectives, taking into account global frameworks such as the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030).
they aim to support decision-makers and relevant stakeholders to make coordinated decisions, including through collaboration across borders for regional development, with a view to reducing conflicts and promoting coexistence and synergies in the maritime domain.
these policy briefs were developed by mspglobal, a joint initiative between unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc-unesco) and the european commission’s directorate-general for maritime affairs and fisheries (dg mare), co-funded by the european maritime and fisheries fund (emff) of the european union. they also represent important inputs to the international msp guidance developed by both institutions.

this approach was enlarged eventually to ocean areas, including in areas beyond national jurisdiction. in this regard, the scholarly work of professor cicin-sain and the network of scholars that she assembled through the global conferences on ocean and coastal areas that she convened since 2001 played a central role in supporting with evidence the need for articulating the un convention on the law of the sea further and to operationalize relevant provisions of it to protect the biodiversity of ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction for the sake of current and future generations.
the passion and unlimited energy and power of listening and of persuasion of professor cicin-sain brought her to be acknowledged as an honest broker by a multitude of non-governmental stakeholders as well as governments in support of formal negotiations on the ocean policy agenda, starting with the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 and continuing relentlessly through the world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 and the rio+20 summit in 2012. during the past few years, the work of professor cicin-sain focused on the need to recognize fully the unique role of the world ocean and coastal areas in climate regulation and the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change, particularly, in the context of the un framework convention on climate change. she was able to rely on the profound sense of mutual respect and trust built over the years to help bring together communities as diverse as knowledge holders and representatives of local and traditional communities, the private sector, non-governmental organizations in charge of ocean advocacy and ocean education in support of the global intergovernmental agenda, thus increasing significantly timeliness, relevance and legitimacy in decision-making. in all of this, she was always and solely motivated by her love for the ocean and profound understanding that only through a collective vision will we be able to ensure ocean sustainability. in all of her work, she always recognized and nourished the contribution of ocean science - from research to observations and also scientific assessments - to the political dialogue on our common ocean, for the benefit of humankind as a whole, also advocating for the work of science organizations such as ioc and fao.
particular recognition deserve the efforts of professor cicin-sain in building capacities of those who were lagging behind in order to ensure that countries and their peoples could benefit from the highest possible level of knowledge and technology in preserving and sustainably using their ocean and coastal areas and resources therein, through the multiple capacity development projects led by her and the global ocean forum, which she founded.
as a teacher, professor cicin-sain leaves a legacy of hundreds of young and less so, considering the 50-year time span of her academic career, ocean professionals that will continue carrying her vision and enseignements, for a better ocean and a better world.

lecture series highlights
the 1st lecture series on getting community tsunami ready and tsunami ready community in india | ioc-unesco tsunami ready  

the inaugural first lecture was attended by 382 participants from 33 countries, 18 of which from the indian ocean region, with individual participants coming from disaster risk management offices, national tsunami warning centres, universities, non-governmental organization, among other institutions. the session was moderated by prof. shahbaz khan, director and representatives of unesco office jakarta, and had two key lectures: bernardo aliaga, head of tsunami unit of ioc unesco and srinivasa kumar tummala, director of indian national centre for ocean information services (india).
mr. aliaga introduced the ioc tsunami ready program aims to encourage and recognize community-based tsunami preparedness, explaining how the program is built on 12 indicators drawn from global best practices in tsunami preparedness, which measure the capacity of a community to respond to a tsunami under three key areas: mitigation, preparedness, and response. the safer ocean objective of the upcoming un decade of ocean science for sustainable development 2021-2030 (referred to as “the ocean decade”) will also act as a catalyst to significantly increase the number of tsunami ready communities worldwide.
going into the regional perspective, prof. khan and dr. tummala discussed about how the tsunami ready program has been successfully piloted in india’s coastal provinces. india took this as an opportunity to strengthen the coastal communities’ knowledge and capacity on tsunami preparedness with strong involvement of every level of the disaster management offices (dmo), at the national level such as ministry of earth sciences, ministry of home affairs, ndma, and province level dmos of odisha, then district, block and village level dmos. ultimately, however, the success rests with communities’ enthusiastic implementation and continuous volunteer work.
at its vital core, the tsunami ready program by unesco’s ioc mends the bridge between scientific organizations, technical organizations, disaster management office, and communities that are more often than not very enthusiastic about having the opportunity to contribute to their own resilience vis-à-vis the destructive menace of tsunamis.
the 2nd lecture series on ioc-unesco tsunami ready takes the topic of tsunami hazard and risk reduction | ioc-unesco tsunami ready indicators 1, 2 and 4

 
the indian ocean tsunami information centre (ioc) – unesco organized the second iotic lecture online series on tsunami hazard and risk reduction: the ioc-unesco tsunami ready indicators 1,2 and 4.  this online lecture, which conducted on 11 september 2020, featured mr. ardito m. kodijat, head of indian ocean tsunami information centre- ioc unesco indonesia, as the moderator and two guest lectures from different institutions, ms. sunanda maneela, indian national centre for ocean information services (icois), dr. harkunti p. rahayu, the chair of working-group 1 of  intergovernmental coordination group on indian ocean tsunami warning and mitigation system(icg/iotwms). 
this 2nd online lecture aimed to improve knowledge and understanding of the ioc-unesco tsunami ready program. furthermore, its objective is to foster the communities, non-governmental organizations, tsunami warning centres, disaster management offices, and other related stakeholders to achieve the tsunami ready indicators and build the community’s resilience.
in the first session, ms. sunanda discussed the importance of a tsunami hazard map for the community. hazard maps, which also depicted the community's socio-economic data, are critical tools for preparing and educating the public about the hazard map and the appropriate response before an impending tsunami. in developing a reliable and science-based tsunami hazard map, the multiple jurisdiction and community engagement are required to create the inundation model. the inundation model is the primary source to illustrate the common areas to be flooded by the tsunami. the community engagement could make a valuable contribution in the map development derived from how people perceive and interpret risks, particularly past experiences. she shared icois’s experience creating the tsunami hazard map, which integrated the local knowledge and technical expertise. ms. sunanda underlined the need of a 5-years review as the coastal regions are the most dynamic areas compared to the other regions because of highly affected by storms, floods, erosion, infrastructure developments, and tourism activities. at the end of the first session, she outlined alternative ways for countries with adequate tsunami modelling capacity. among others are the community engagement in selecting a good elevation and identifying all areas below the elevation to create tsunami hazard maps.
the lecture proceeded with dr. harkunti’s explanation of knowing how to expose a community to tsunami hazards. this topic discussion corresponded to the indicator two on developing an initial estimate of the number of people living in the tsunami hazard zone and indicator four on expanding an inventory of available resources to reduce tsunami risk at the community level. dr. harkunti affirmed that these indicators are the key ingredient of formulating the tsunami risk reduction plan. this plan is a guideline for the community to face the challenges. in developing of that plan, the participatory approach is essential to strengthening the ownership or sense of belonging from the community. she pointed out the two schemes in creating a participatory process. the triple helix consists of community, government, and business sector. while the community acted as the main actor due to their knowledge, exposures, and experiences, the government and business sector support the community’s initiatives financially and legally. the second scheme is penta helix, which adds two other actors: academics and media. the academic will provide a scientific insight into the community’s initiatives and upscale the community's data. at the same time, the media disseminates the best practices and information to other regions. besides the participatory approach, formulating a tsunami risk reduction plan requires the coverage of all disaster stages from pre-disaster and post-disaster activities.
in responding to the 2nd indicator, dr. harkunti stressed the importance of providing meaningful and precise data to better risk reduction plans and emergency response. she stated that calculating temporary and non-residents such as migrant workers and visitors are as crucial as the permanent residents. as for indicator 4, she fostered to take local wisdom and enough financial resources such as the village fund in the indonesia case – into consideration. she added that the budget mismanagement and negligence of local knowledge and social could have a severe impact of developing and implementing tsunami risk reduction plans.
around 390 participants in zoom and 43 participants in the facebook live engaged in the discussion.  it estimated 44 countries where 15 of them from the indian ocean member states. this second lecture received positive feedbacks from the participants, where 387 participants were pleased with the lessons. the participants felt that the course gave a good insight into disaster management and community building. furthermore, the lecture was helpful for the participant’s work in various fields ranging from tsunami warning centre, disaster management offices, university, to business sectors.
the 3rd iotic online lecture series on tsunami information and evacuation plan | ioc- unesco tsunami indicators 3 and 5

in the third lecture, the indian ocean tsunami information centre (ioc) – unesco organized the  iotic lecture online series on tsunami hazard and risk reduction: the ioc-unesco tsunami ready indicators 3  and 5.  this online lecture, which conducted on 18 september 2020, featured mr. ardito m. kodijat, head of indian ocean tsunami information centre- ioc unesco indonesia, as the moderator and two guest lectures, mr. nick kuster, nsw state emergency service australia, and mr. harald spahn, tsunami early warning and mitigation expert, germany. this 3rd online lecture aimed to improve knowledge and understanding of the ioc-unesco tsunami ready program. furthermore, its objective is to foster the communities, non-governmental organizations, tsunami warning centres, disaster management offices, and other related stakeholders to have a public display of tsunami information and produce easily understood tsunami evacuation map in collaboration with the local community.
in the first session, mr. nick kuster discussed the tsunami information’s public display corresponding the indicator 3 of ioc -unesco tsunami ready. he underlined the importance of the public display of tsunami information, which has a considerable role in protecting people, providing valuable information for related stakeholders’ decision making, and strengthening community resilience. in formulating tsunami information, it should convey a simple, clear, and non-ambiguous message to the public. furthermore, the public tsunami information should raise awareness instead of instilling fear in the community. mr. nick pointed out that the public display of tsunami information could be in the form of billboards and signages. he affirmed the previous lecture on the importance of the community’s engagement and other stakeholders in developing the tsunami information, designing evacuation strategy and map,
the lecture proceeded with mr. harald spahn discussing on the tsunami evacuation plan. he outlined the evacuation planning process consisting 5 processes. first, preparing the planning requires relevant data, resources, and related stakeholders, particularly the local community. the next process is the design of the evacuation strategy and map. it is essential to calculate and consider evacuation time, safe areas, assembly point, evacuation modes, shelter, routes, signages, self-evacuation timing, and other supports. mr. harald continued the process with the public assessment, local endorsement, and dissemination of the plan. the sixth process is evaluating the plan through tsunami simulation exercise as the means of observations and improvement. in the last second session, mr. harald reiterated the importance of the evacuation plan, which has a vital role in community preparedness. therefore, it is crucial to engage the expert and more related stakeholder involved in developing the tsunami evacuation plan.
around 363 participants in zoom and 45  participants in the facebook live engaged in the discussion.  it estimated 29 countries where 16 of them from the indian ocean member states. this third lecture received positive feedbacks from the participants, where most participants were pleased with the lessons. the participants felt that the course broadened their horizons about tsunami and enhanced participants' capacity in various fields, particularly teachers, to disseminate the tsunami information.
the 4th iotic online lecture series on tsunami education, outreach, and exercise | ioc- unesco tsunami ready indicators 6, 7, and 8

public outreach, education, and annual exercise are essential to enhance the community’s preparedness and resilience. in the fourth iotic lecture series, ioc -unesco organized an online lecture on tsunami education, outreach, and exercise corresponding tsunami ready indicators 6,7 and 8.  this online lecture, which conducted on 25 september 2020, featured mr. ardito m. kodijat, head of indian ocean tsunami information centre- ioc unesco indonesia, as the moderator and two guest lectures, ms. ghazala naeem, tsunami early warning and mitigation expert, pakistan, and ms. weniza, the agency for meteorology, climatology, and geophysics (bmkg) indonesia. this 4th online lecture aimed to improve knowledge and understanding of the ioc-unesco tsunami ready indicators related to public outreach, education, and regular exercise.
in the first session, ms. ghazala discussed the community tsunami and education outreach. she outlined the various factors to be considered in developing tsunami education and outreach material. among others are having good tsunami evacuation maps, observing natural signs, and responding to official warnings, what to do before and immediately after a tsunami. developing tsunami education and outreach should consider the local scenarios where it includes local geographical, environmental, and cultural features. ms. ghazala also pointed out various ways to reach the community, such as a brochure, public services, local faith organizations, local radio, historical sites, social media, and bulk emails. furthermore, she underlined the importance of annual exercise to educate the community about tsunami and other hazards, evacuation routes, and how the information will be received.
the lecture proceeded with ms. weniza on tsunami exercise. she mentioned the indian ocean-wide tsunami exercise (iowave) is an effective tool to evaluate the readiness of the operation of the tsunami service providers and the indian ocean member states’ national tsunami warning centers, disaster management organizations (dmos), and community in responding to potentially destructive oceanwide tsunamis. it also provided the opportunity for indian ocean countries to test their communication methods and review their sops, tsunami emergency response plans, and tsunami emergency preparedness. furthermore, in this session, she outlined in detail the planning of the tsunami exercise. first, ensuring the tsunami exercise is part of national, local, and community strategy and policy to build preparedness. second, exercise should be equipped with proper training. the next process is to analyse the goals with the three following scenarios based on the need and purpose of the exercise depending on the local context:
if the goal is only to initiate the development of sops or resource integration, then orientation drill may suffice;
if the goal is to raise awareness and introducing evacuation procedure, then drill exercise is needed;
if the goal is to validate the communication system, warning chain, or sops, table top or even full-scale training can be done.
at the end of the second session, ms. weniza stressed the importance of the exercise's quality control to ensure that the activity meets the objectives.
around 368 participants in zoom and 47 participants in the facebook live engaged in the discussion.  it estimated 29 countries where 16 of them from the indian ocean member states. this fourth lecture received positive feedbacks from the participants, where most participants were pleased with the lessons. the participants felt that the course gave them insight and raise their awareness about the importance of tsunami education and exercise for the community.

								Date: 4 November 2020","https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/tsunamiday, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","communities in antigua and barbuda, barbados, st. vincent and the grenadines, and in trinidad and tobago have recently been recognized as “tsunami ready” at the end of a two-year tsunami early-warning and preparedness project funded by the european commission and implemented by the intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) of unesco.
the regional efforts led by ioc and funded by the humanitarian aid department’s disaster preparedness programme (dipecho) to bolster tsunami preparedness in the caribbean and adjacent regions focused on coordination, hazard assessment, warning communication, preparedness activities, response and resilience to tsunamis and other ocean hazards. the project supports more widely the global efforts coordinated by the ioc to advance global coastal hazard early warning and preparedness.
across the four caribbean countries, the communities participating in the project fulfilled 10 requirements necessary to be awarded ioc’s pilot community performance based tsunami recognition, meaning they are recognized by international standards as tsunami ready. the communities in the four countries covered by the project were the first in their country to receive the unesco recognition, and have now joined over sixty (60) tsunami ready communities in the region.
“with the support of the dipecho-unesco/ioc project and partnering initiatives, the national emergency management organisation (nemo) in st. vincent and the grenadines coordinated with the union island district disaster committee and the community of union island to develop and enhance capacities for tsunami warning communication as well as inundation and evacuation mapping for that island. we look forward to working with the ioc and partners to make other vulnerable communities in st. vincent and the grenadines tsunami ready,” emphasized ms. michelle forbes, director, national emergency management organisation, st. vincent and the grenadines.

elsewhere in the caribbean and adjacent regions, the project also targeted disaster management officials, partners, and populations in three (3) additional pilot countries by supporting national and community activities towards tsunami ready recognition of puerto plata (dominican republic), and providing signage and equipment to reinforce preparedness in anguilla and the british virgin islands, recognized as tsunami ready territories in 2011 and 2014, respectively.
the ioc-dipecho project encompassed regional, national and community activities and stakeholders, including the unesco cluster office for the caribbean, the caribbean disaster emergency management agency (cdema) and its regional response mechanism (rrm), the us noaa nws caribbean tsunami warning program (ctwp), the seismic research centre of the university of the west indies st. augustine (src), and the united nations development programme for barbados and the oecs (undp).
the project delivered a number of pioneering tools and mechanisms to support and streamline the regional and national disaster management landscape, including:
a “tsunami annex” to the regional coordination plan (rcp)
national and community tsunami protocols and standard operating procedures and associated multi-media tools
the establishment of a group of experts to develop a strategy for the integration of other coastal hazards into the intergovernmental coordination group of the caribbean early warning system (icg/caribe ews)
updates to the rcp earthquake and volcanic annexes, generic tsunami warning protocol
advancement on the work of the experts on tsunami sources for the lesser antilles
a tsunami art school contest also showcased the remarkable creativity of the caribbean youth in promoting public engagement from an early age with the important issues of community preparedness against tsunamis.
dr silvia chacón-barrantes showcased the project’s role for strengthening the region’s overall capacity for tsunami warning and preparedness: “the dipecho-unesco/ioc project proved very important for the regional tsunami early warning system. not only for enhanced tsunami preparedness and support to the tsunami ready recognition programme, but with the establishment of the group of experts on other coastal hazards and the definition of possible tsunami sources at the lesser antilles, there is a sustainable regional framework for deeper partnerships and coordination towards wider efforts of building of a regional multi-hazards early warning system.”
the project contributed to various international and regional strategies such as the regional comprehensive disaster management (cdm) strategy and programming framework 2014-2024; the samoa action plan for sids, the global action programme on education for sustainable development; the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015-2030, and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. 
the tsunami ready pilot project implemented by unesco’s ioc and its intergovernmental coordination group for the caribbean early warning system (icg/caribe ews) is modeled after the successful us tsunamiready program, and is being rolled out with various regional adaptations under global unesco leadership.

								Date: 6 November 2020","https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","from the start of the vendée globe race, 10 skippers will carry scientific instruments onboard to support the global ocean observing system, within the framework of the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030).
the collaboration is developed under the coordination of the global ocean observing system (goos), supported by unesco through its intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc).
“about 2,000 autonomous instruments (such as profiling floats and drifting buoys) must be deployed every year to sustain the global ocean observing system. usually, the deployment of ocean observing instruments is done through research oceanographic ships, which are very costly and not able to sail everywhere throughout the ocean regardless of the season. racing yachts allow us to reach remote and not yet well sampled areas of the ocean, filling critical observational gaps, especially during this challenging pandemic period” says mathieu belbéoch, oceanops lead.

goos is a collaborative system of continuous in situ and satellite ocean observations, implemented by numerous programmes and organisations. these observations provide key oceanographic and meteorological data for several applications, such as climate studies, forecasts and early warnings, and marine ecosystems health monitoring. 
the in situ observing network, implemented by 86 countries, is internationally coordinated and monitored in real-time by oceanops, joint centre of ioc/unesco and the world meteorological organisation (wmo) under goos.
currently, 10,000 in situ observing instruments, including networks of autonomous profiling floats, drifting and fixed buoys, piloted underwater robots, ships, sea level tide gauges, and even marine mammals, monitor the global ocean and measure its main physical and biogeochemical parameters.   
in january 2020, a partnership was signed between unesco and imoca (international monohull open class association) to support ocean science and protection of the ocean. for 2 years, these organisations will carry out various joint projects including met-ocean observations.
in 2020, 6 drifting buoys and 1 argo profiler float were deployed by the imoca skippers during the vendée-arctique-les sables d’olonne race.
today, the imoca skippers take things up a notch, confirming their deep commitment to the protection of the ocean. during the vendée globe, with the help of oceanops, 7 météo france meteorological buoys and 3 argo france profiling floats, will be deployed by the imoca skippers, in under-sampled areas of the ocean.  
“this initiative will help to better understand the changing climate. i will deploy the profiler float leaving the pot-au-noir, a shipping route which is usually sparsely navigated. though the float weighs 20 kg and keeping extra weight to a minimum is crucial for the race, it is worthwhile. this is my choice. the future of the planet is seriously in danger”, says louis burton, bureau vallée 2/imoca skipper.   

“being able to contribute to the planet’s well-being in such a concrete way, deploying a scientific weather buoy, is an important part of this race for me. i am already an ambassador for my own region, the baltic sea, which requires constant vigilance in order to safeguard it and its heritage for future generations. the baltic sea is a part of the larger ecosystem including the entire ocean. and the ocean gives us this life we are living. that is why we all must act” says ari huusela, stark/imoca skipper.

the atmospheric pressure data acquired by the drifting buoys and transmitted, in real-time, to the operational centres will help to improve weather forecasting. additionally, the high-quality temperature data from profiling floats will enable scientists, throughout the world, to significantly improve the estimates of ocean heat storage. 
the scientific actions carried out by the imoca skippers, during their trip around the world, will be a significant contribution to the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development, which begins on 1 january 2021.
“one of the ocean decade challenges is to ensure a sustainable ocean observing system that delivers timely data and information accessible to all users on the state of the ocean across all ocean basins. the imoca skippers, with their commitment to the ocean observations, today, become real sailors for science and ambassadors of the ocean decade” says albert fischer, director, goos project office at ioc/unesco.

list of sailors deploying scientific instruments during the vendée globe 2020:
drifting buoys: romain attanasio, manuel cousin, maxime sorel, ari huusela, stéphane le diraison, alexia barrier and kojiro shiraish
profiling float: alexia barrier, boris herrmann and louis burton
four skippers, didac costa, boris herrmann, alexia barrier and fabrice amedeo will also carry onboard oceanographic instruments to measure sea surface salinity, temperature and co2. fabrice amedeo will also measure the microplastics pollution at sea.

the iowave20 exercise will test national tsunami warning systems and preparedness protocols against three possible scenarios in which earthquakes at various points in the region could send giant waves traveling across the ocean basin in the direction of the region’s vulnerable coastal communities.
indian ocean “wave” exercises are held every two years under the auspices and coordination of unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission, the intergovernmental coordination group of the indian ocean tsunami warning and mitigation system (icg/iotmws) and the indian ocean information centre (iotic).
for iowave20, the scenarios include earthquakes with epicentres in the java trench on 6 october, andaman trench on 13 october, and makran trench on 20 october. for each scenario, the region’s tsunami service providers – national institutions who act as providers of alerts and early warning information for a number of subscribed countries in the indian ocean region – will issue four tsunami bulletins in real-time over a one-hour duration.
these scenarios enable countries in the region to review their national tsunami response procedures, plans and policies to account for the occurrence of a tsunami or other natural disaster, test communications protocols and conduct a “virtual” tabletop exercise, as a minimum, to assess organisational standard operating procedures, plans and policies for tsunami warning and emergency response.
all this in the backdrop of the covid-19 pandemic.
the sanitary situation has already reduced the scale of the iowave20 relative to previous exercises, with each country individually assessing the health risks to determine the appropriate level of participation in the simulation exercise while ensuring no interference with physical distancing measures already in place.
to continue shielding their population from the risk of tsunamis and other ocean hazards amid the pandemic, national decision-makers can rely, among other tools, on unesco’s guidelines for adapting tsunami warning services, evacuation and sheltering during covid-19, released earlier this year in several versions adapted to the regional realities and needs. the general guidelines for the indian ocean were also complemented by a national guide for indonesia.  
tsunamis and other natural disasters (i.e. cyclones, floods, fires, etc.) can occur at any time, even during a pandemic, requiring governments and emergency responders to be prepared to make quick and informed decisions on community evacuations within a context of social distancing.

in operation for over 15 years, the karachi gauge provides valuable sea level data from an under-sampled region of the world to the global sea level observing system (gloss), coordinated by the ioc. the gauge’s operation was interrupted for a short period during 2019 and 2020, due to hardware failures.
support from unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) and from the uk national oceanography centre enabled the pakistan hydrographic department to carry out all the necessary repairs to the karachi tide gauge despite severe covid-19 restrictions in place, assuring a continuous monitoring of tides and flow of sea level data for national, regional and global sea level rise modelling.

the gloss karachi tide gauge was originally installed in 2005 by the pakistan hydrographic department with the help of the uk national oceanography centre (noc), and consists of several sensors, which included the first commercial sea level radar sensor, the kalesto, manufactured by ott hydromet.
in addition to the one-minute sea level data being stored locally for use by the hydrographic department, the data collected by the gauge is also transmitted at 15-minute intervals, using a constellation of meteorological satellites of the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites (eumetsat).
with the help of the ioc sea level station monitoring facility, this data is then displayed and archived for access by the wider scientific sea level community and the operational tsunami service providers (tsps) for the indian ocean tsunami warning and mitigation system (iotwms).
around 2009, the gauge became part of the ioc/unesco’s odinafrica project, where additional funds were made available for support and maintenance. unfortunately, this operation was interrupted for a short period during 2019 and 2020, due to hardware failures.

this substantial contribution will add 500 floats to the global argo network in the next five years (see networks map below) and will boost the array to meet 50% of its target for global biogeochemical sampling of the ocean.
the investment marks the next phase of the argo implementation story that started in the 2000s with the core argo mission to measure and map ocean heat. twenty years later and with an array of 4000 floats, argo plays a vital role in our climate and weather forecasts.
the new biogeochemical (bgc) profiling floats, sampling the ocean from surface to a depth of 2000m, will provide the first global maps of ocean chemistry and biology. this data will be the foundation for the first global view of the ocean health and enable us to track the large-scale patterns of climate change on ocean chemistry and life, providing connection between many coastal monitoring data sets. it will also support development of new ocean forecast capabilities.

this evolution of the argo array is the result of two decades of progress with float and sensor technology. the bgc sensors will measure dissolved oxygen concentration, ph, nitrate concentration, chlorophyll concentration, nutrients and downwelling irradiance. these data will enable observation of the health and productivity of ocean ecosystems, monitor the biogeochemical cycles of  carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and biomass in the ocean regardless of the season, improve climate and fisheries numerical models, as well as forecast the variability and effects of ocean warming and acidification on sea life.
after 10 years of international cooperation and technical adaptation to become an operational reality, the argo network is now fit for providing the science leapfrogging required from the upcoming un decade of ocean science for sustainable development. fourteen countries have been supporting the bgc argo mission through several regional pilots.

“the go-bgc array will extend the regional bgc-argo observing programs that have been built by the international community to the global ocean. these combined efforts will produce a global system for observing the impact of climate variability on the ocean and ocean life.” ken johnson, mbari and pi for the go-bgc array project

this major us national science foundation investment of $53 million over 5 years is a great step forward and hopefully will encourage other countries to use this momentum and further develop their bgc argo component. to support the international argo coordinating infrastructure and help communicate on the outcomes of this expansion, a bgc argo focal point position will be established monaco in 2021, funded by the société des explorations de monaco, and forming part of the oceanops team.
the expansion of the global ocean observing system (goos), coordinated by unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission, across more climate and ocean health related observations is vital for future information services around the blue economy and the sustainable management of our ocean resource. further projects across the observing system platforms in support of this expansion of ocean data into the chemical and biological realms can be expected to form part of the ocean decade of ocean science for sustainable development.

the purpose of the exercise was to assess local tsunami response plans, increase preparedness for such events and improve overall coordination. the exercise also intended to contribute to the objectives of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development, launched on 1 january 2021 under the aegis of ioc-unesco.
""making 100% of tsunami-prone communities tsunami-ready and resilient is an ambitious goal necessary for the survival of all. this exercise should therefore make it possible to test the procedures of the tsunami warning system and identify the operational strengths and weaknesses of the caribbean countries.""
vladimir ryabinin, ioc-unesco executive secretary

the last two tsunamis in the caribbean sea hit haiti in 2010 and honduras in 2018. over the past 500 years, 75 tsunamis have occurred in the caribbean. this year's exercise, entitled caribe wave 21, simulated two earthquakes in jamaica in the lesser antilles. mock messages were issued by the pacific tsunami warning centre (ptwc) and sent to participating countries.
from the yucatan peninsula and central america in the west to the lesser antilles in the east, from cuba in the north to colombia and venezuela in the south, the coastal populations of the caribbean are particularly vulnerable to tsunamis. while the 2019 exercise brought together nearly 800,000 people, the number of participants in 2020 was eight times lower (103,000) as a result of restrictions due to the covid-19 pandemic. emergency management authorities in each affected state established the level of participation and public involvement in the exercise.
media, schools, businesses, religious organizations and families were encouraged to register their participation in this new exercise, while respecting coronavirus guidelines. civil protection authorities also had the possibility of carrying out different types of exercises, including an actual evacuation.
regional and national ocean tsunami warning systems must maintain a high level of preparedness so that all actions essential to people’s safety can be triggered in a timely manner. indeed, there must be an immediate response to sudden and evolving natural disasters, such as tsunamis. to maintain a high level of preparedness, national tsunami warning centres and civil protection authorities must regularly test their emergency response procedures through practice. this includes ensuring that vital communication links are operational, that response personnel are fully aware of their role and able to act with the utmost urgency during such an event. in case of an alert, people on average only have 30 minutes to react.
christa von hillebrandt-andrade, director of the caribbean programme of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) and coordinator of the exercises, emphasizes that tsunami-ready communities can receive tsunami ready recognition: “tsunami ready communities must prepare tsunami prevention and action plans. in the absence of recent tsunamis in the region, conducting these exercises remains an excellent way to keep citizens and government officials on their toes.”
a tsunami is caused by a submarine or coastal earthquake occurring at a depth of less than 50km. and having a magnitude of at least 6.5 on the richter scale. earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 8.7, such as the one in japan on 11 march 2011 and the one in sumatra on 26 december 2004 (9.2), cause major tsunamis leading to flooding along the coasts.

the non-paper recognises that the success of the new regulatory framework for biodiversity in the high seas will be strongly dependent on the availability of ocean scientific knowledge and services, including data and information, capacity building and transfer of marine technology.
the ioc is already providing important ocean science services relevant to the future agreement, including services related to ocean observations, access to data and information, area-based management and capacity building and transfer of marine technology.
ioc is also developing a clearing house mechanism that could house both existing and future expanded services from ioc and services partners directly related to the four principal issues of the bbnj process – marine genetic resources; area-based management, including marine protected areas; environmental impact assessments; and capacity building and transfer of marine technology.
the clearing house mechanism could also enhance collaboration between partners inside and outside the united nations system.
as significant investments have been made to develop existing services within ioc and partners, the non-paper argues that it would be more cost effective to build on the foundation that already exists than to redevelop new services from scratch.
unesco’s ioc also recognizes the opportunity provided by the upcoming un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030) to support the bbnj process, by providing a framework for significant investment in knowledge generation, capacity building and transfer of marine technology, and data and knowledge management initiatives that align with the priorities of the bbnj process.

								Date: 15 April 2021","https://oceandecade.com/edit_news/117/v.lindoso@unesco.org, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","panerai and the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco (ioc-unesco) are partnering to develop ocean literacy activities in the framework of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030). 
by supporting the ocean decade, panerai reinforces its commitment to a sustainable environment and a healthy ocean. the company’s engagement is couched on a rich heritage of respect for the ocean in the development of instruments for the italian navy and modern-day ocean explorers. 
the partnership between ioc-unesco and panerai will develop a programme of work around ocean literacy to ensure that citizens, stakeholders and institutions understand the their interaction with the ocean and apply this knowledge to develop transformative solutions toward building a more sustainable, equitable society. 
though the ocean is powerful and immense, it is also vulnerable to a multitude of environmental threats. to date, over 40% of the ocean’s surface is strongly affected by multiple drivers, and 66% is estimated to be experiencing increasing cumulative impacts mainly from land- and human-based sources. 
from 2021 to 2030, the ocean decade will promote science-based management of the ocean and marine resources to achieve the goals of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, bringing together expertise from a vast body of disciplines, industries and actors to move from the ocean we have to the ocean we want. 
the unesco-panerai contribution will aim to invest in the creation of resources and the organization of activities to enable citizens to embrace a more responsible mindset and behavior towards the ocean and its preservation. this will center around developing educational and research initiatives, providing values and knowledge and enhancing an active community of ocean literacy professionals and communicators.
 
“every part of our organization, from our brand ambassadors to staff will be engaged in this movement. panerai has always been known for its pioneering role and in this case, we want to set new boundaries in terms of environmental responsibility and overcome them, being one of the first mover in the watch industry to raise awareness towards such an important topic and change the game. our goal is to become a key player, not only an example for our competitors, but also for our suppliers, our customers and all the people that are involved in panerai on a worldwide level. as a company, we have the responsibility to be active and support the urgent need for change and help protecting our planet, empowering everyone to take direct action to take care of it. the more we can work together, the better”, says ceo jean-marc pontroué.

 “the next ten years will be crucial to reverse the decline of ocean health worldwide. the ocean decade aims to create a transparent and accessible ocean whereby all nations, stakeholders and citizens have access to ocean data and information. to this purpose, education will be at the heart of this partnership with panerai. together, we will develop ocean literacy activities, helping to weave together the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.” explains vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of ioc-unesco. “we are pleased to work with panerai, accelerating together progress for the sustainable development goal 14, life below water, and sdg 4, quality education.”

defined as the understanding of the ocean's influence on us, and of our influence on the ocean, ocean literacy is a key framework to create a society able to make informed and responsible decisions. as a global leader in ocean literacy, unesco’s ioc celebrated the 2020 world oceans day with a deep dive into this increasingly influential field that combines ocean research and management with education and learning.
under the theme ""ocean literacy in the context of un decade of ocean science for sustainable development 2021 – 2030"", the summit focused on answering questions such as how ocean literacy can help transform ocean knowledge into action; which ocean literacy strategies are needed to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goal 14; how to bring together different backgrounds, actors and perspectives to use ocean literacy as a vehicle to inspire action; and how to create learning opportunities through worldwide collaboration and partnerships.
""in the face of covid-19, world oceans day is a key to bring together the global ocean community, strengthening international collaboration and maintaining momentum for decisive and innovative actions. this is particularly important as we move towards the launch of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development. (…) however, innovation and action can only happen when knowledge is available to everyone."" said audrey azoulay, general director of unesco.
the new european ocean coalition (eu4ocean) initiative on ocean literacy was officially launched during the event through a video of the commissioner for environment, oceans and fisheries, virginijus sinkevicius. aligned with the theme of the year’s (""innovation for a sustainable ocean""), an ocean literacy video was produced by ""the experiential atelier"" with an artist collective featuring altin gün's new music ""kesik çayir"" with an immersive computer-generated animation by mixed reality specialist can büyükberber.
""everyone is a stakeholder in education for sustainable development and every country should benefit from the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and seas. unesco’s ocean literacy framework and approach are encouraging capacity building programs, supporting communities of practice and promoting continuous professional development in the field of marine science and climate change"", explained vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of unesco’s ioc.
the summit consisted of three panels that investigated the role of the ocean in connecting, inspiring and engaging people from across the globe. it featured 19 speakers** from a vast diversity of sectors including the media, private sector, governments, civil society, arts, ngos and the scientific sector.

interactive discussions, with the more than 1600 participants, centered on how ocean literacy can catalyze advocacy for sound marine policy and public action, mainstream ocean topics into educational systems, foster more responsible citizenry and behavioral changes, encourage ocean aware corporate practices, and stimulate young people to start a career in the ocean affairs.  participants highlighted the potential that the un decade of ocean science offers in term of developing innovative and transformative actions across different groups of stakeholders
""while the ocean is suffering from climate change – including ocean acidification, sea rise level, and deoxygenation – the decade will provide a common framework to ensure that science can fully support countries’ actions to sustainably manage marine ecosystems. ocean science should remain at the heart of the education system while our ocean is being jeopardized."" stated peter thomson, un special envoy for the ocean.
unesco’s ioc will continue to work in close collaboration with all the players involved in environmental and scientific education to develop tools that will improve the dissemination and mainstreaming of ocean literacy methodologies. an ""ocean literacy strategic plan to support the un decade of ocean science (2021-2030)"" will be released by unesco’s ioc on january 2021.

entitled ‘1 ocean, the great testimony’, the exhibition explores an oceanic heritage whose preservation has become imperative for the future of our planet. the twenty underwater photographs exhibited in the open air - some of which are unpublished – will be the starting point for a more ambitious project in the framework of the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030). these photographs are the first steps in the ‘1 ocean’ project that alexis rosenfeld and unesco will launch to take 1,000 photographs during the decade. 
taken from the mediterranean sea to the coral sea natural park in new caledonia, one of the largest protected marine areas, these twenty photos will reveal the beauty of small, little-known organisms whose role is essential to the balance of the ocean, as well as that of the majestic whale shark, symbol of power and fragility, like the ecosystem in which it evolves. the exhibition will allow visitors to plunge into the heart of a coral culture, a half-animal, half-mineral being whose life depends on the microscopic algae that feeds it. its future and the one of marine biodiversity, depends on our ability to tackle the challenges of global warming and threats posed by pollution or devastating fishing methods. 
this project aims to highlight the central role of scientific knowledge by relying on the power of images to change our behavior. one of the first threats weighing on the ocean lies in our lack of knowledge of a vital ecosystem.
for the executive secretary of the ioc-unesco, vladimir ryabinin, ""sharing knowledge, transmitting knowledge, raising awareness about this wonderful world without borders is one of the key actions of the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco. ‘1 ocean, the great testimony' acts as a relay for unesco's environmental concerns to decision-makers, scientists and the general public"". 

with 150 member states, the ioc-unesco promotes international cooperation in marine science to improve the management of the ocean, coasts and marine resources. ioc-unesco coordinates several tsunami warning programmes. 
as a professional photographer and diver, alexis rosenfeld, who was a crew member on commander cousteau's last expedition to madagascar, also participated in the discovery of the wreck of antoine de saint-exupéry's plane.

								Date: 14 October 2020","https://www.goosocean.org/, https://oceanfrontierinstitute.com/, https://oceandecade.org/, https://public.wmo.int/en, https://www.unep.org/, https://council.science/, https://youtu.be/5eUwEzeW3Kc, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","scientific director and ceo of canada’s ocean frontier institute (ofi), dr. anya waite, has been selected as co-chair of the prestigious global ocean observation system steering committee. she is the first woman at the head of this body since its creation in 2011.
the global ocean observing system (goos) has named its first female co-chair at a crucial time for operational ocean science.
established in 1991, the global ocean observing system (goos) is a collaborative system of ocean observations encompassing in situ networks, satellite systems, governments, un agencies and individual scientists, which provide ocean observing data and assessments to feed global and national models for climate predictions, weather forecasting, maritime operational services, and marine ecosystem health monitoring. ocean observations are the key to help us understand, manage and prepare for the ocean’s many impacts on human life, including as a regulator of the earth’s climate system.
with the pandemic severely impacting traditional observing systems and networks around the world, global coordination is more than ever important to ensure our knowledge gathering continues in these unprecedented circumstances.
“climate change won’t wait,” says dr. waite. “but travel restrictions are keeping scientists from retrieving important equipment. we are on the verge of losing years of essential data that will help us understand ocean changes. we need to think creatively and goos is just the place to do that.”
dr. waite will be the only canadian on the multinational committee, and the first woman co-chair since the committee was created in 2011. the multinational steering committee under her co-leadership provides oversight of goos activities and governance framework, including the expert panels and operational teams, regional alliances, development projects, and the coordination of oceanographic and marine meteorological observing, data provision, and services.
dr. waite leads the ocean frontier institute, a transnational research hub, overseeing 23 large research projects studying the ocean’s most pressing issues, and delivering results and recommendations to inform government policy, community development, and industry needs. it was created in 2016 thanks to a $94-million grant from the canada first research excellence fund.
“the global ocean observing system is delighted to be joined by dr. waite as co-chair of the steering committee. the energy, dedication and deep understanding of the ocean, observing system and key groups working on ocean matters will be a tremendous gain for goos,” says dr. toste tanhua (germany), fellow colleague co-chair. “the connection to the canadian efforts on building a national observing system (cioos) and the ground-breaking efforts by ofi in partnering with the private sector as well as the oceanographic community mainly around the atlantic will be very important for goos in this new and exciting decade.”
the appointment comes at a crucial time in the context of preparations for the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030), set to start on 1 january 2021 to provide the knowledge, capacities, resources and political momentum required to reverse the cycle of decline in ocean health. activities under the goos framework will be key to enabling the decade’s aim of large-scale transformation in ocean science and its use toward global sustainable development goals.
dr waite is well-positioned to have meaningful input into this conversation, after ofi hosted the north atlantic ocean decade planning workshop in halifax in january 2020. the workshop provided a forum to gather 150 ocean leaders/champions/key stakeholders to discuss and prioritize concrete deliverables and partnerships to meet the decade's societal objectives.
“building partnerships - across scientific communities and institutions, from observing infrastructure to users, and across the globe - these are key to building a sustainable observing infrastructure,” says albert fischer, goos office director based at ioc/unesco. “we’re excited to work with dr. waite and a renewed goos steering committee membership to build these lasting partnerships.”
in addition to goos, dr. waite sits on the boards of canada’s ocean supercluster and the marine environmental observation, prediction and response network (meopar). she is on the editorial board of the international journal limnology and oceanography, co-chair of the scor working group on biological observation systems, “p-obs” and was on the steering committee of the southern ocean observation system (soos) 2017-2020.
goos is co-sponsored by the intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) of unesco, the world meteorological organization, the united nations environment programme, and the international science council.

the aim of the exercise was to assess the local action plans to respond to the risk of tsunamis, to increase preparedness for such events and to ensure good overall coordination between the communities and competent authorities. called neamwave21, this event was the fourth of such exercise, following those of 2012, 2014 and 2017. a similar exercise will take place in the caribbean on 12 march. 
regional and national ocean tsunami warning systems need to maintain a high level of preparedness so that all actions essential for the safety of people can be triggered in a timely manner. there must be an immediate response to natural disasters with rapid onset and evolution, such as tsunamis. to maintain a high level of preparedness, national tsunami warning centres and civil protection authorities must regularly put their emergency response procedures to the test. this includes ensuring that vital communication links are operational, that response personnel are fully aware of their role and able to act as quickly as possible during such an event. 
""this exercise should make it possible to test the procedures of the tsunami warning system and to identify operational strengths and weaknesses in each country."" vladimir ryabinin, ioc-unesco executive secretary

three simulations were planned as part of the neamwave exercise21 :
eastern mediterranean: on 8 march, at 9 a.m. (utc), an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.7 at a depth of 20 km off the coast of cyprus;
central mediterranean: on 9 march, at 9 a.m. (utc), an earthquake 7.9 to 10 km deep off the coast of calabria (italy);
north-east atlantic: on 10 march, at 9 a.m. (utc), an earthquake 8.6 to 5 km deep off the coast of portugal, equivalent to the earthquake that destroyed lisbon in 1755.
civil protection authorities were in a position to carry out different types of exercises, up to and including an actual evacuation. following the ""north-east atlantic - lisbon earthquake of 1755"" scenario, the exercise also simulated a request for international assistance. it was coordinated by france's tsunami warning centre (cenalt) and the portuguese institute of the sea and atmosphere (ipma). 
a tsunami is caused by a submarine or coastal earthquake occurring at a depth of less than 50km. and having a magnitude of at least 6.5 on the richter scale. earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 8.7 - such as the japanese earthquake of 11 march 2011 and the sumatra earthquake of 26 december 2004 (9.2), cause major tsunamis leading to coastal flooding.

								Date: 25 May 2020","https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","approximately half of those vessels were already operating within the global voluntary observing ship (vos) scheme under the global ocean observing system (goos), and the goal is now to have the entire maersk fleet in various vos fleets by the end of 2020.
weather and sea state observations have been collected and disseminated on a systematic basis for over 150 years. they provide essential data on meteorological conditions at sea for weather forecasts and, over long-time scales, help climate scientists understand climate change. ship observations, alongside other ocean, land-based, and satellite observations, are ingested into global and regional climate analyses, as well as coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models, which depict the evolution of our environment. these observations also help to ensure safety of life and property at sea by allowing better forecasting of storms and other extreme ocean-related events.
a typical vos produces observations manually, with a vessel’s crewmember reading data from instruments aboard (see figure below), or automatically, through automated weather stations (aws) installed, for example, on the ship’s deck. these data are then sent ashore to the national meteorological services (nms) for use in weather prediction models and to check actual conditions at sea.

to get more data with a higher precision, the first five maersk vessels were equipped with an aws of type eucaws (european common automatic weather station). these systems – provided and installed by dwd, the german nms – automatically acquire data on atmospheric pressure, air temperature and relative humidity and transmit them hourly.
by the end of 2020, a total of 50 such stations are planned to be operational, providing the largest fleet of aws from one single company.
“as a global container logistics company, our vessels form a vital part of our network and ability to move global trade in a safe and timely fashion. helping weather forecasting and climate science advance makes great sense to maersk as they touch our operations in various ways,” said aslak ross, head of marine standards at a.p. moller - maersk. “if we can help facilitate even marginal improvements to the quality of weather routing services, these will be important levers in our constant efforts to improve the safety of our crews and assets and ensure reliable arrival times for our customers’ cargo. to simplify this for our crew and standardize our reporting, we found it beneficial to have one standard and a global point of contact with the voluntary observing ships scheme.” 
this is where henry kleta, the global lead of the vos scheme, stepped in to help. “it was important to support maersk to have many new vos stations providing measurements of sea conditions in real-time across the global oceans. that is clearly a priority for us,” said kleta.
while there continues to be over 3,000 ships participating in the vos scheme, there has been a decline in their number, mainly due to the contraction of available financial and human resources. however, new technologies, such as awss and electronic logbooks, have led to an increase in the quantity and quality of observations from each vessel participating in a smaller, active vos fleet. “the maersk commitment is very welcome,” says kleta, “and it is a great example of science-commercial collaboration at an international level for the benefit of society.” aslak ross continues, “climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the global community and impacts our business as well as the societies and customers we serve and partner with in enabling trade. we have an ambitious strategy to decarbonize our fleet of vessels by 2050 and as we move on executing it, we are proud to have our vessels and crews help researchers in gaining a better understanding of this key global challenge and the impact it has on our surroundings.”
“i believe the work we are doing with maersk is having a great impact,” said darin figurskey, the global lead for ship observations team (sot) under goos and a forecaster himself at the u.s. national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa). “while working a shift over christmas, i received a very timely ship report from a vessel. the wind was reported at 37 knots, with seas of 9.8 feet at the time of the observation. this validated a satellite measurement we received around the same time and the gale warning we had in effect for seas to 10 feet. i sent a note of thanks to relay to the vessel and it turns out that vessel was a maersk vessel!”
the global ocean observing system (goos) coordinates the key global ocean observing networks, including the vos scheme, and is a joint programme of unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc), the world meteorological organization (wmo), the united nations environment programme (unep) and the international science council.

considered as the most popular media - 75% of households have access to a radio in developing countries; the radio provides a wide pf possibility to share real time and reliable information. through programs, broadcasts and news, this communication tool is an inclusive platform allowing dialogue and democratic debate around sensitive subjects such as climate change, rising sea levels and risks associated with natural disasters.
committed to share all the latest ocean news with the wider public, unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission made a series of podcasts providing better knowledge of the marine environment and the objectives of the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030).
what are oceans issues and threats?
within the radio program produced at unesco headquarters “many voices, one world”, two experts were interviewed: they highlighted the need to promote a sustainable management of marine resources to achieve the objectives of sustainable development goals fixed by the un. discover these inspiring interviews online:

did you know that oceans are hosting data transmission?
it has been more than two centuries that data are travelling underwater using oceans to carry information. while traditional ""tools such as the telephone and telegraph allowed communications over long distances, their use was only possible through wire-based electrical systems. the scope of the challenge ahead was clear: how human could transmit information across continents despite ocean space?
in 1838, first submarine cables were tested but failed to ensure the appropriate connection of information for being leaky and poorly isolated. it was not until 1851 that the first commercial submarine telegraph cable was developed under the channel tunnel (connecting england to northern france): the core of the cable was made with the gutta percha (a gum made from natural latex). 
this new ability to spread information has been quickly used by maritime and military organizations: at the beginning of the xxth century, thousands of submarine cables were in service around the world. this number constantly increased and recently reached 1.2 million kilometers: more than 99% of the world's data traffic are crossing seas and oceans (source: telegeography)!

these guidelines aid to clarify possible confusion generated by covid-19 sanitary priorities and regulations in regard to response actions during a tsunami warning such as evacuation and sheltering.
“there is general acceptance that the life-saving response to an imminent natural hazard should take priority over mitigation measures instated during a pandemic. however, proper advance planning can assist in adopting procedures to minimize the spread of infection during evacuation and sheltering,” argues thorkild aarup, head of the tsunami unit within the secretariat of unesco’s ioc.
best practices for evacuation during a pandemic are not unique to tsunami hazard. the same guidelines could apply to other coastal hazards such as storm surges generated by tropical storms, floods and flash floods. it may be recalled how the recent cyclone amphan that occurred during an ongoing covid-19 pandemic necessitated large scale evacuations in bangladesh and india.
beyond best practices for evacuation and sheltering during the covid-19 pandemic, the guidelines include details of regional tsunami services, to be used by national authorities responsible for the organisation of tsunami warning and emergency response to develop nationally coordinated guidelines.
the four regional guidelines published by unesco’s ioc were complemented by a special national version for indonesia, considering the country’s tragic recent history of tsunamis since the indian ocean tsunami in 2004, including the more recent sulawesi and sunda strait tsunamis in september and december 2018, respectively.

“our community would like to thank unesco-ioc for this recognition, and for enhancing the sustainability of our community against tsunami hazard,” remarked appa rao, community leader at venkatraipur village.
tsunami ready recognition is achieved through satisfying multiple initiatives. these include conducting a community tsunami-risk reduction programme, designation and mapping of tsunami hazard zones, public display of tsunami information, easily understood tsunami evacuation maps, outreach and public education materials, participation in mock drills, community emergency plans, and the presence of reliable 24-hour early warning system.
collectively, the tsunami ready certification check-list aims to improve tsunami preparedness in coastal communities, to minimize the loss of life and property, and to ensure a structural and systematic approach to building community preparedness.
the tsunami ready programme is administered by unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) through its intergovernmental coordination group for the indian ocean tsunami warning and mitigation system (icg/iotwms). in order to promote tsunami ready piloting, the indian ocean tsunami information centre (iotic), together with the iotwms secretariat, developed regional guidelines and conducted four regional trainings on tsunami emergency maps, plans and procedures (tempp) involving 22 indian ocean member states.
addressing the new tsunami ready communities, ardito kodijat (head of the iotic) emphasized the importance of taking the tsunami ready certification as a continuous process. “this recognition is an achievement, but not the ending, it is a start of new responsibility to continue to be prepared and be example to the others,” he explained.
in odisha state, unesco’s ioc and the government of india (via its national tsunami ready board and ministry of earth sciences) recognized the tsunami ready recognition for venkatraipur and noliasahi through a virtual ceremony. high profile speakers included dr. rajeevan, secretary of india’s ministry of earth sciences; prof. dwikorita karnawati, chair of the icg/iotwms; dr. satheesh shenoi, vice chair of unesco’s ioc, and mr. g v v sarma, secretary of india’s national disaster management authority.
the authorities congratulated the communities on achieving tsunami ready recognition and encouraged wider adaption of this programme for enhancing the safety of all vulnerable communities from coastal hazards.
“odisha state is motivated to make all 326 villages and urban local bodies tsunami ready in 1-years’ time”, said managing director p.k. jena of odisha state disaster management authority.  coastal communities in other indian ocean member states have also expressed interest in preparing for future tsunami events by fulfilling the unesco-ioc tsunami ready indicators.
srinivasa kumar tummala, head of the iotwms secretariat, insisted on the potential for scaling up tsunami ready recognition in the region: “venkatraipur and noliasahi achieved the distinction of becoming first in the indian ocean to become tsunami ready, and we hope this recognition by unesco-ioc will catalyse wider implementation in other communities in india and the wider indian ocean region.”
the tsunami ready programme is a key contribution by unesco’s ioc to the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development, set to officially begin on 1 january 2021, and which aims to build capacities of countries, communities and citizens to reduce and appropriately respond to the risk posed by tsunamis and other ocean-related hazards.

nonetheless, the iotwms is not a static system and must improve, evolve and adapt to serve the needs of its member states. in this context, the 2018 assessment identified capacity gaps and future support requirements in the broad areas of a) policies, plans and guidelines; b) risk assessment and reduction; c) detection, warning and dissemination; and d) awareness preparedness and response. the detailed capacity assessment of tsunami preparedness status report 2018 together with responses of member states, as well as a succinct executive summary have been prepared for wide communication to all stakeholders.
the 2018 assessment was conducted through an online survey more than 13 years after the initial assessment of the state of tsunami preparedness in indian ocean countries following the boxing day tsunami (ioc/inf-1219), which provided critical inputs to the eventual design and development of the indian ocean tsunami warning and mitigation system (iotwms).
unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc), through the iotwms secretariat and the indian ocean tsunami information center (iotic) will continue to coordinate and facilitate the efforts of member states and donor agencies to bridge gaps in capacities and strengthen the end-to-end tsunami warning and mitigation system in the indian ocean. the ioc would like to congratulate the icg/iotwms, its task team on capacity assessment of tsunami preparedness, and, most importantly, all member states and experts who contributed to this important assessment.

as jcomm has just been retired as a collaborative mechanism in a governance reform, the history highlights the value of wmo-ioc co-sponsored programmes working in frontier research and science:
the world climate research programme (wcrp) covers the whole climate system, including the oceans, focused on topics such as regional sea level variations and coastal impacts, the ocean’s contribution to the world’s energy, heat, water and carbon budgets and the interactions between the physical climate and ecosystems.
the global climate observing system (gcos) and the global ocean observing system (goos) contribute to continuous monitoring of the state of the ocean and provide data crucial to informing weather and climate predictions.
within goos, the argo programme - with almost 4,000 subsurface floats in the ocean at present – has been an extremely successful international scientific innovation and cooperation programme over the past two decades and has been critical to expanding our understanding of the ocean and climate. the argo programme is supported by a legacy of jcomm: a joint wmo-ioc centre for in situ ocean and marine meteorological observing programme support (jcommops).
the long history of partnership between wmo and unesco’s ioc was further cemented via a newly established joint collaborative board in 2019. in a welcome recent development for the wmo, ioc and imo, the global shipping company a.p moller - maersk committed its entire fleet of 300 vessels to contribute marine meteorological data in support of climate and weather forecasts under the wmo-ioc voluntary observing ship (vos) scheme.

based on a co-sponsored pices and ioc-scor globalhab workshop on evaluating, reducing and mitigating the cost of harmful algal blooms, this report compiles case studies on the economic impacts of habs on farmed salmon and shellfish, and on wild-caught, reef-based fisheries, with the aim to guide future research and management decisions as to mitigate the risks associated with these natural events.
the report shows that hab-related losses faced by insurers of aquaculture operations make up to 45% of insurance claims – and they are larger than any storm that insurers have ever faced.
despite the several research initiatives of the last two decades, the lack of data, appropriate and standardized protocols, and the dearth of peer-reviewed studies hamper efforts to quantify the societal costs of hab events, which are increasingly frequent, intense, and long-lasting.
as of today, most countries have neither conducted economic analyses of habs nor collected data that can be used to generate reliable quantitative estimates of net economic losses and impacts.
as a consequence, it is hard to develop effective strategies to prevent, control and mitigate hab events.
among the most effective strategies for mitigation of hab-associated risks, data and information play a key role for better forecasts.

the huge hab-related losses to industry, consumers, and governments illustrate the need for insurers, the aquaculture industry, public health professionals, economists, and hab scientists to work together to better understand the environmental drivers and economic impacts of hab events, with the aim of using such knowledge to come up with solutions to mitigate risks.
the report benefitted from the expertise of over 48 international experts on economics, insurance of aquaculture companies, and the science of habs from australia, canada, china, chile, france, japan, korea, norway, scotland, spain, the united arab emirates, the uk, and the usa.

the report confirms information in a provisional statement issued at the un climate change conference in december that 2019 was the second warmest year in the instrumental record. 2015-2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850.
2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1°c above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong el niño event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend.
“we are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5°c or 2°c targets that the paris agreement calls for,” said united nations secretary-general antonio guterres in a foreword.
“this report outlines the latest science and illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate action. it brings together data from across the fields of climate science and lists the potential future impacts of climate change – from health and economic consequences to decreased food security and increased displacement,” he said.
the report was launched at a press conference given by the un secretary-general and wmo secretary-general petteri taalas at un headquarters on 10 march.
“given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. a recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. it is a matter of time,” said wmo secretary-general taalas.
“we just had the warmest january on record. winter was unseasonably mild in many parts of the northern hemisphere. smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in co2 emissions. reported record temperatures in antarctica were accompanied by large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier which will have repercussions for sea level rise,” said mr. taalas.
“temperature is one indicator of ongoing climate change. changes in the global distribution of rainfall have had a major impact on several countries. sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, largely due to the thermal expansion of sea water as well as melting of the largest glaciers, like in greenland and antarctica. this is exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas,” said mr taalas. 
oceans 
marine heatwaves: more than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. in 2019, ocean heat content down to a depth of 2 kilometres exceeded the previous record highs set in 2018.
ocean warming has widespread impacts on the climate system and contributes more than 30% of sea level rise through thermal expansion of sea water. it is altering ocean currents and indirectly altering storm tracks and melting floating ice shelves. together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation, ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems. in 2019, the ocean experienced on average nearly 2 months of unusually warm temperatures. at least 84% of the ocean experienced at least one marine heatwave.
ocean acidification: in the decade 2009-2018, the ocean absorbed around 23% of annual co2 emissions, cushioning the impacts of climate change but increasing ocean acidity. the change of ph reduces the ability of marine organisms such as mussels, crustacean and corals to calcify, affecting marine life, growth and reproduction.

ocean deoxygenation: both observations and models indicate that oxygen is declining in the open and coastal oceans, including estuaries and semi-enclosed seas. since the middle of the last century, there has been an estimated 1%–2% decrease (77 billion–145 billion tons) in the global ocean oxygen inventory.
marine ecosystems: deoxygenation alongside ocean warming and acidification is now seen as a major threat to ocean ecosystems and the wellbeing of people that depend on them. coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%-30% of former cover at 1.5°c warming, and to less than 1% at 2°c warming.
sea level has risen throughout the satellite altimetery record (since 1993), but the rate has increased over that time, mainly due to melting of ice sheets on greenland and antarctica. in 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on the record. 
ice: the continued long-term decline of arctic sea ice was confirmed in 2019. the september monthly average extent (usually the lowest of the year) was the third lowest on record with the daily minimum extent tied for second lowest.
until 2016, antarctic sea ice extent had shown a small long-term increase. in late 2016 this was interrupted by a sudden drop in extent to extreme low values. since then, antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels.
the greenland ice sheet has recorded nine of the 10 lowest surface mass balance years in the last 13 years. and 2019 was the 7th lowest on record. in terms of total mass balance. greenland lost about 260 gt of ice per year over the period 2002-2016, with a maximum of 458 gt in 2011/12. the loss in 2019 was 329 gt, well above the average.
glaciers: preliminary results from the world glacier monitoring service indicate that 2018/19 was the 32nd consecutive year of negative mass balance for selected reference glaciers. eight out of the ten most negative mass balance years were recorded since 2010.
climate-related impacts
the report devotes an extensive section to weather and climate impacts on human health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life. this is based on input from a wide variety of united nations partners. (see in editor’s note for full list)
high impact events
tropical cyclones: tropical cyclone activity globally in 2019 was above average. the northern hemisphere had 72 tropical cyclones. the 2018-19 southern hemisphere season was also above average, with 27 cyclones. tropical cyclone idai made landfall in mozambique on 15 march as one of the strongest known on the east coast of africa, resulting in many casualties and widespread devastation. idai contributed to the complete destruction of close to 780 000 ha of crops in malawi, mozambique, and zimbabwe, further undermining a precarious food security situation in the region. the cyclone also resulted in at least 50 905 displaced persons in zimbabwe, 53 237 in southern malawi and 77 019 in mozambique. one of the year’s most intense tropical cyclones was dorian, which made landfall with category 5 intensity in the bahamas. the destruction was worsened as it was exceptionally slow-moving and remained near-stationary for about 24 hours. typhoon hagibis made landfall west of tokyo on 12 october, causing severe flooding.

the leaders of australia, canada, chile, fiji, ghana, indonesia, jamaica, japan, kenya, mexico, namibia, portugal and ocean panel co-chairs norway and palau today released the transformations for a sustainable ocean economy: a vision for protection, production and prosperity. these world leaders understand that the ocean is central to life on earth, peoples’ livelihoods and the economy, but also recognize that the ocean’s health is at risk from pressures such as pollution, overfishing and climate change. this is why, two years ago, ocean panel members set out to develop a transformative set of recommendations to deliver a sustainable ocean economy that would benefit people everywhere and effectively protect the ocean. the result is a new ocean action agenda that – if achieved – could help produce as much as 6 times more food from the ocean, generate 40 times more renewable energy, lift millions of people out of poverty, and contribute one-fifth of the ghg emissions reductions needed to stay within 1.5°c.
“for too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. no longer. building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time,” said erna solberg, prime minister of norway and ocean panel co-chair.

“at a time when we are already looking to recover from the unprecedented covid-19 pandemic, we understand how vulnerable we are to financial shocks and health crises,” said tommy remengesau jr., president of palau and ocean panel co-chair. “we need the ocean more than ever to drive a sustainable, long-term recovery. the ocean is our past, our present and our future. we do not have to choose between ocean protection and production; we can have both for a healthy, prosperous and equitable tomorrow if we properly manage our impacts upon it.”

leading by example, the ocean panel countries each committed to put a sustainable ocean plan in place by 2025. the ocean panel also supports a global target to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030, where each country’s contribution will depend on national circumstances. in addition to the 100% sustainable management commitment, there are 74 priority actions detailed in the transformations that achieved consensus from the 14 countries. the recommendations focus on five critical areas: ocean wealth, ocean health, ocean equity, ocean knowledge and ocean finance. together, they point to where the world should be in the next decade, when the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development conclude. the ocean panel commits to deliver on these actions by 2030 or sooner.
the ocean panel’s bold yet pragmatic recommendations are underpinned by an unprecedented scientific knowledge base for action, including 20 commissioned reports and blue papers. the new report released today, ocean solutions that benefit people, nature and the economy, seeks to define a new solutions-based relationship between humanity and the ocean. the report finds that achieving a sustainable ocean economy is possible and beneficial, but it will not happen if business as usual continues. the paper identifies five key pathways to achieve the transition.
“the 14 countries on the ocean panel are listening to science, learning from each other and working together. that’s a powerful combination. if their historic commitments are implemented, the resulting successes will snowball into an avalanche of smart actions by other key players – enabling people, nature and the economy to thrive,” said hon. jane lubchenco, phd., distinguished university professor at oregon state university and co-chair of the ocean panel expert group.

as the world looks to recover from covid-19 and the resulting economic fallout, the ocean can bring economic relief and make communities stronger. ocean panel research shows that a healthier ocean is a smart investment: every $1 invested in sustainable ocean solutions can yield at least $5 in benefits, including social, health, economic and environmental benefits. another ocean panel-commissioned paper finds that including the ocean economy in recovery and stimulus measures – especially with the pandemic’s devastating impacts on coastal workers and sectors – would have huge benefits. the research identifies immediate opportunities for a blue stimulus that can create jobs, provide economic relief and push the economy towards resilience and sustainability.
“we need better management and sustainable use of the ocean’s resources to foster not only a green, but also a blue recovery from the covid-19 pandemic,” said antónio guterres, secretary-general of the united nations.

efforts are already underway to accelerate, scale and finance the new ocean action agenda. this includes multi-stakeholder coalitions focused on ocean renewable energy, ocean accounting, shipping decarbonization, tourism and blue food. the ocean renewable energy action coalition (oreac), the first coalition to publicly launch, published the power of our ocean report to support governments across the world in scaling development of ocean-based renewable energy.
the ocean panel transformations on the eve of the ocean decade
the transformations are released on the eve of the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (“ocean decade”, for short) which will start on 1 january 2021.
throughout the work of the ocean panel, the contribution of ocean science to a sustainable ocean economy has been emphasized and the panel recognises that ‘the ocean decade represents a unique opportunity to enhance the scientific understanding of the ocean.’
the ocean decade will help to generate the knowledge needed for science-informed policies and actions, thus playing a key, complementary role in enabling the actions formulated by the ocean panel. in early 2021, a new report will be released by the ocean decade, further analysing the ocean panel recommendations and articulating how transformative science actions can be designed through the decade framework.
norway announces support to the ocean decade
as part of its voluntary contributions to unesco for 2020-2021, the norwegian ministry of foreign affairs and the norwegian agency for development cooperation (norad), pledged nok 20 million to support the work of the ioc in fostering scientific cooperation for the management and protection of the ocean and coastal zones, as well as its leading role in coordinating the ocean decade.
further to this, norway has recently announced the design of a national plan of investments in ten priority areas for ocean science in the next decade, relevant to norway and for which norway can contribute substantial expertise also to global research.

								Date: 23 November 2020","https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KN885MK, https://oceanexpert.org/, https://ioc-cd.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewEventDocs&eventID=2694, https://www.ioc-cd.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewDocumentRecord&docID=27430, https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KN885MK, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","the second session of the ioc group of experts on capacity development (ge-cd) was held online on 26 october 2020. the meeting discussed, among other things, the preliminary results of the capacity development needs assessment survey, the contribution of ioc to the capacity development chapter of the ocean decade, and agreed on extending the current cd strategy to 2023. 
the expert group examined the preliminary results of the second capacity development needs assessment survey, which was launched on 1 september 2020 and will remain open until 1 february 2021. it was noted that, as of 12 october 2020, 874 responses were received, representing 87 ioc member states from the developing countries. however, it was agreed that more efforts are needed to reach out to countries. the group requested its members as well as ioc cd focal points and ioc regional offices to promote oceanexpert within their country, region and other community to obtain better coverage of the survey and instructed the secretariat to send reminders to member state contacts that have not responded to the survey yet.
the group also noted that the upcoming un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030, “ocean decade” for short) should bring to light the already existing capacity development initiatives – including those carried out by the ioc – and benefit from them at the same time, by incorporating the ocean decade outcomes and challenges into graduate and undergraduate courses.  
as the current ioc cd strategy was developed for the period 2015-2021 and will “expire” in december 2021, the group also recommended that the end date of the current strategy should be extended to the end of 2023. in addition, the group decided to establish the “ge-cd task team related to the revision of the ioc cd strategy (2015-2021)” and to submit its report for consideration by the 31st session of the ioc assembly (2021). the group instructed the new task team, when established, to start its work as from 15 november 2020 and to submit its work to the co-chairs of the ge-cd not later than 1 march 2021 for its approval and subsequent submission to the 31st session of the ioc assembly.
among other things, the group also decided to:
re-elect mr ariel troisi and mr alan evans as co-chairs of the ioc group of experts on capacity development;
abolish the inter-sessional task team on the implementation of a tmt/chm portal - as it was reported that all required actions had been completed during the inter-sessional period - and requested the ocean infohub project to regularly report to the ge-cd on its work plans, activities and results.
continue the inter-sessional task team on cd requirements but with revised terms of reference, taking into account the instruction by iode-xxx to “repeat the cd survey at regular intervals (biannually)”. the revised terms of reference of the task team will be defined via online consultations by december 2020.
the meeting was attended by 63 participants including members of the ioc group of experts on capacity development, ioc cd national focal points, invited experts and members of the ioc secretariat.

by jens boel - a danish historian and unesco's chief archivist from 1995 to 2017, he initiated the unesco history project in 2004, to encourage the use of its archives. boel's next book, exploring the ocean, on the history of the ioc, will be published in 2022.
between 1959 and 1965, forty-five research vessels sailing under fourteen different flags explored the indian ocean. atlases, maps and scientific studies resulting from this expedition revolutionized geological, geophysical and marine-biological knowledge of this ocean. the monsoon and its variations were better understood, and food resources and mineral deposits discovered. the expedition also enabled countries like india, indonesia, pakistan and thailand to build or expand their marine science infrastructures. the international indian ocean expedition (iioe) was unique, and at the time, was the biggest ocean exploration ever launched.
co-ordinating this unprecedented international research effort was the first major activity of the intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc), which celebrates its sixtieth anniversary on 14 december 2020.
knowledge sharing
the journey towards the creation of the ioc had been a long one. already, at the first session of the general conference in november 1946, india had proposed the creation of an institute of oceanography and fisheries to study the indian ocean. however, the first political initiative to make unesco include marine science activities in its programme came from japan. in 1952, the country presented a draft resolution with the purpose of engaging unesco to promote international co-operation on oceanography. this was done with the view to optimize the use of marine resources – fisheries, minerals and energy – and thereby “provide a basis for the peaceful coexistence of all mankind”. 
never before had ocean sciences been so high up on the international political agenda 

the proposal was well-received, but did not lead to any significant commitment of unesco’s resources. the breakthrough came at the next session of the general conference, in 1954, when japan again proposed that unesco should launch a marine sciences programme. 
the international geophysical year (igy), from july 1957 to december 1958, was an essential part of the dynamics that eventually led to the creation of the ioc. during this time,  the igy formed the framework for a vast range of global geophysical activities. 
the best known of these is the soviet launch of sputnik i, the first artificial satellite, but the igy also greatly enhanced the interest of the international community in oceanographic projects. 
this interest was driven by a variety of motivations – in particular an interest in waves, currents and tides; concerns about radioactive pollution; the search for food and other resources in the ocean; the wish to explore the deep sea bed, and to understand the interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere. the idea that it was necessary to collect and share data on a global scale on all these subjects was gradually gaining ground.
in july 1960, unesco convened an oceanographic conference in copenhagen, denmark. delegations from thirty-five countries gathered with representatives of other united nations agencies and international organizations. they recommended that unesco establish a new intergovernmental body to promote the scientific investigation of the ocean. 
the proposal was accepted in december 1960 by the general conference. it was unprecedented. never before had ocean sciences been so high up on the international political agenda. 
from idea to action
in the beginning, the ioc’s place in unesco was far from obvious. some of the scientists who took the initiative to create the commission would have preferred the establishment of a separate united nations agency, the world oceanographic organization (woo). other un agencies questioned why unesco should take the lead in this particular field. for instance, both the food and agriculture organization (fao) and the world meteorological organization (wmo) put forward their expertise in fisheries and meteorology respectively. 
issues about ‘who should do what’ have remained a challenge over the years, but most ioc activities have been carried out in close co-operation with un agencies and other stakeholders. the ioc also has a recognized role in the un convention on the law of the sea (unclos), the global legal framework for the ocean.
another challenge was the scope of the mandate of the new commission. one of the debates at the beginning was whether it should mainly support the most advanced research to push the boundaries of human knowledge of the ocean as quickly as possible, or concentrate on building the oceanographic capacities of developing countries. in reality, the ioc has been  doing  both, with a greater emphasis on capacity development today.
during the sixty years of its existence, the ioc, which now has 150 member states, has gradually reoriented its emphasis towards systematic, sustained observation systems  – such as the global ocean observing system (goos), created in 1991 – and the overarching concept of sustainable development. at the same time, research and knowledge sharing on all ocean science-related topics, such as the global ocean science report, remain the leitmotif of its work. 
research and knowledge sharing on all ocean science-related topics remain the leitmotif of the ioc’s work

an early accomplishment was the establishment, in 1961 of the international oceanographic data and information exchange (iode), which remains a cornerstone programme of the ioc. among its projects since 2009, is the ocean biodiversity information system (obis). 
another highlight of the ioc’s activities is the pacific tsunami warning and mitigation system (ptws). created in 1965 to save lives, it has since served as a model for other exposed regions – including the indian ocean, the caribbean, the north-east atlantic and the mediterranean. 
the ioc ensured the leadership of the international decade of ocean exploration (1971-1980), to raise awareness of the importance of ocean science. so it was only natural that fifty years later, the commission took the lead when the un proclaimed a decade of ocean science for sustainable development from 2021 to 2030.

jamie mcmichael-phillips, seabed 2030 project director, said:
“the sustained increase in data available to map the ocean floor will enable seabed 2030 to play a leading role in delivering a comprehensive set of authoritative data that is freely available for all to use. this is a leap forward towards achieving our mission, by the year 2030, to empower the world to make policy decisions, use the ocean sustainability and undertake scientific research based on detailed bathymetric information of the earth’s seabed.
“my thanks go out to all who have contributed data and technical expertise to bring together this new 2020 grid. with the support of governments, industry, academia and philanthropy, and by using innovative technology, we anticipate availability of new data to grow on a yearly basis.
“it’s encouraging to see what working collaboratively, across the globe, can achieve. seabed 2030 will continue to seek out new partnerships and technological advancements. everyone has a part to play in contributing to our ocean mapping journey: a journey that will greatly benefit humanity.”
the chairman of the nippon foundation, mr yohei sasakawa, recently announced three initiatives that need further collaborative activity in accelerating the mapping of the ocean floor – these include supporting the mapping of unexplored areas, collecting data through crowdsourcing, and advancing technology for data collection.
seabed 2030 continues to act as a catalyst for the unprecedented growth in available bathymetric data. a complete map of the world’s ocean will facilitate a heightened understanding of fundamental processes including ocean circulation, weather systems, sea level rise, tsunami wave propagation, tides, sediment transport, benthic habitat distributions and climate change.
it will also be a key enabler of other deliverables under sustainable development goal 14, to conserve and sustainably use the oceans – all of which echo the goals of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development.

about the nippon foundation-gebco seabed 2030 project:
the nippon foundation is a private, non-profit foundation established in 1962, in japan, for the purpose of carrying out philanthropic activities, using revenue from motorboat racing. the foundation places an emphasis on social innovation, and implementing ideas to bring about change for a better society. its activities encompass wide-ranging areas such as the fight against leprosy, peacebuilding in myanmar and passing on the riches of the ocean to the next generation.
the general bathymetric chart of the oceans (gebco) is a joint project of the international hydrographic organization (iho) and the intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) of unesco – the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization. it is the only intergovernmental organisation with a mandate to map the entire ocean floor. it has its origins in the gebco chart series initiated in 1903 by prince albert i of monaco, and aims to provide the most authoritative, publicly-available bathymetric datasets for the world’s oceans.
the nippon foundation-gebco seabed 2030 project is a collaborative project between the nippon foundation and gebco. the seabed 2030 project, launched at the united nations ocean conference in 2017 by chairman sasakawa of the nippon foundation, coordinates and oversees the sourcing and compilation of bathymetric data from different parts of the world’s ocean through its five centres into the freely-available gebco grid. four regional centres cover the southern ocean, the arctic and north pacific ocean, the atlantic and indian oceans, and the south and west pacific ocean. these feed data products into the global data centre, southampton.
find out more about the project and how to get involved.
world hydrography day takes place annually on 21 june. this international day was adopted by the international hydrographic organization (iho) as an annual celebration to publicise the work of hydrographers and the importance of hydrography.

								Date: 12 February 2020","https://council.science/, https://council.science/current/topic/ocean-decade/, https://www.goosocean.org/, https://scor-int.org/, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","engaged in joint worldwide cooperative projects since the 1990s, the world’s two leading scientific cooperation organizations have signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) in light of their common determination to work together on the development and implementation of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (the ocean decade).
unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) and the international science council (isc) signed their new mou yesterday, at unesco headquarters, setting in motion a far-reaching framework of cooperation in support of the un ocean decade, due to start officially in january 2021.
key planned actions include promoting the ocean decade among the scientific community, contributing to decade preparations, accelerating scientific initiatives, and exploring opportunities for joint fundraising for scientific research.
“the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development is a unique opportunity to engage the ocean science community in achieving the sustainable development goals - globally, regionally and locally. representing scientists from all fields of knowledge, the international science council is particularly well-placed to help us mobilize and realize the full potential of the global scientific community in unlocking solutions for the ocean we want,” emphasized ioc executive secretary vladimir ryabinin during the signing ceremony.
isc ceo heide hackmann reiterated the importance of the new framework for cooperation: “by signing the memorandum of understanding we reaffirm our commitment and determination to jointly deliver on the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development. the world is looking to the scientific community for leadership that bolsters actionable research to provide much-needed solutions for a healthy and sustainable ocean.”
the renewed partnership stands to give the ocean decade important leverage and visibility within the scientific and technological community, its core constituency when it comes to organizing and delivering multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary knowledge. combining the various scientific and policy networks of both organizations will be crucial to ensuring that the decade can effectively harness the energy and represent the priorities of key ocean stakeholder groups at the global and regional level.
beyond the substantive development of the decade and its research portfolio, the mou identified communication and outreach as one of the main axis for joint action. isc is committed to promoting the ocean decade and its activities among its membership and wider community, which includes international scientific unions and associations, national and regional academies of science and research councils, international initiatives (e.g., on data, antarctic research, space, oceanic research, and government science advice), as well as its key partners (e.g., belmont forum and the world federation of engineering organizations).
since november 2019, the isc and ioc have been co-producing a series of blogs featuring new voices we need to hear from across human, natural, social and traditional sciences, if the ocean decade is to be truly inclusive and multidisciplinary. the series can be followed via this link.
bringing together 40 international scientific unions and associations, over 140 national and regional scientific organizations, and numerous scientific working groups, the international science council has traditionally cooperated with unesco’s ioc, which has a global membership of 150 countries, in the fields of ocean sciences, climate sciences and related observations, and capacity development.
in particular, the two paris-based organizations helped found and remain at the helm of two key international ocean science initiatives: the global ocean observing system (goos), a worldwide collaborative network of in situ and satellite observing systems, governments, un agencies and individual scientists; and the scientific committee on oceanic research (scor), an international body anchored within the isc whose mandate is to address interdisciplinary science questions related to the ocean.
the ioc-isc partnership illustrates well the importance of collaboration between international scientific organizations, who together can mobilize key national, regional and global actors across the science-policy-society nexus to generate knowledge for the benefit of humankind.

data and information play an essential role in connecting knowledge generators and end users, but many challenges and disparities still exist in the access, sharing and use of ocean data across regions. the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030, the “ocean decade” for short) is a once in a lifetime opportunity to overcome many of these challenges and to develop a global digital ocean ecosystem, founded on universal data, metadata and data sharing principles.
the ioc promotes ocean data and information sharing through its international oceanographic data and information exchange (iode) programme, which is currently leading the construction of a foundation for a so-called “global digital ocean ecosystem”: the ocean data and information system (odis). by encouraging the alignment of existing systems with a common interoperability architecture that is co-designed, co-implemented and co-governed by its partners, odis will be a digital ecosystem where all components will operate using the same rules, thus improving access, sharing and use of data.
as first step, an odis catalogue (odiscat) of resources was developed, which provides an index and guide to navigate and discover the diversity of the existing ocean-related data systems and sources. all ioc-associated online resources will be consolidated in odiscat as part of the ocean infohub (oih) project.
the information collected through this workshop will feed back into the work of the iode intersessional working group to develop the strategy for ocean data and information stewardship (iwg-sodis) of the decade, which the organizations who participated in the workshop were invited to join.
the workshop was attended by 84 participants from 43 different organizations, who add on the 44 participants from un agencies that participated in the first online workshop last 20 april.

								Date: 4 March 2020","https://oceandecade.org/events/86/Foundations-Dialogue-for-the-Ocean-Decade-, https://on.unesco.org/2VFq08m, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","over twenty of the world’s leading ocean-minded foundations took part in a two-day dialogue on building partnerships to enhance and drive ocean action into the next decade. co-organized by unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission and velux foundations (denmark), the international dialogue has triggered a series of outreach initiatives aimed at mobilizing the global philanthropic community around the upcoming un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030).
the united nations ocean decade presents a historic opportunity to reverse the decline in ocean health and achieve the 2030 agenda by advancing scientific knowledge, fostering technological innovation and building capacity. but to succeed in this transformative endeavour, the international community must engage with the fastest-growing sector in the fields of technological innovation and social transformation, the world of philanthropy.
though the role of public financing for ocean science and management remains dominant across the globe, the balance is shifting to accommodate the growing importance of philanthropic actors. foundations and private donors are engaging ocean science at increasingly active levels, financing ground-breaking research, developing innovative solutions to ocean-related developmental issues, and contributing to policy and scientific priorities setting.
hosted by denmark’s the velux foundations at the danish royal academy of science and letters, the foundations dialogue for the decade of ocean science for sustainable development welcomed at once foundations interested in the decade’s potential for scientific and social transformation, and foundations who have already made solid contributions or commitments to decade preparatory activities.
“the velux foundations wish to contribute to a sustainable balance between the use and the conservation of our ocean resources. a healthy ocean is part of the answer to solving climate change, feeding a growing population and getting clean reliable energy. the ocean decade is a unique opportunity to drive action and build global momentum towards a healthy ocean. we are proud of partnering with ioc unesco to foster dialogue with foundations on this crucial agenda,” reiterated hans kann-rasmussen, chair of the velux foundations.
the dialogue presented the objectives of the un ocean decade, opening a global conversation about how to accelerate ongoing and potential initiatives, partnerships and issue platforms in the next ten years, and what this implies in terms of opportunities for philanthropic actors. through interactive thematic and networking sessions, participating foundations discussed how they can work together around specific contributions to the 2030 agenda sustainable development goals.
“the foundations dialogue for the un ocean decade is a first step to acknowledge and fully incorporate philanthropy as a driving force for delivering the ocean we need by 2030. partnerships within this sector will be key to a successful and meaningful decade, so it only makes sense that we spend as much time and make as much effort as it takes to build a strong basis and framework for these partnerships to flourish, aligned with the decade objectives,” explained vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission.
foundation representatives welcomed the truly consultative nature of the meeting: “i had questions about the meeting before deciding to attend. what convinced me was the affirmation by unesco’s ioc of the importance of both exploratory and solutions-inspired science to support the ocean decade, and that the ioc and velux foundations wished to facilitate dialogue among philanthropies that support such research. i look forward to how the conversation evolves,” said jon kaye, science program director at the gordon and betty moore foundation.
the dialogue gathered members from the top leadership of philanthropic institutions engaged in ocean issues worldwide. and it could not come at a better time for changing the tide against an increasingly threatened marine environment, and in a difficult context for many countries and regions struggling to mobilize the resources and develop the capacities required to fulfil commitments around the sustainable development goals.
“talent is equally distributed among people and countries, but opportunity is now. in the next ten years, we need to build those opportunities. in a respectful collaborative approach between developed and developing countries,” urged asha de vos during her testimonial about the importance of ocean science to developing countries. ms de vos is the founder and executive director of oceanswell, a sri lanka-based marine conservation research and education organization.
“foundations like the group boticario foundation have an important role in generating good science, delivering inspiring communication and engaging society for marine conservation. we are strongly committed to getting the best possible results from our investment on conservation and the ocean decade is an opportunity to amplify our impact,” said ariel scheffer da silva, vice-president of the boticario group foundation’s board of trustees.
focused on fostering concrete collaboration between the world’s major ocean philanthropies, the foundations dialogue marked the signing of new partnerships in support of the un decade.
signed in the presence of the rev ocean ceo, nina jensen, and the executive secretary of unesco’s ioc, vladimir ryabinin, the new partnership between the two organizations will contribute to common areas of activities in the context of the ocean decade such as facilitating open access ocean data, promoting marine scientific research using the rev ocean vessel, and promoting capacity building and enhancement.
rev ocean ceo nina jensen said: “we are super-excited to be working with the ioc which is an extremely important organization for fostering international cooperation in ocean research and management. this is a partnership that is designed to achieve concrete and important results for the health of the ocean, and we can’t wait to get started on our joint initiatives. we will be strong supporters of the un decade of ocean science and tailor our activities to maximize synergies. we encourage everyone in the ocean space to do the same.”
rev ocean also signed a partnership with the ocean foundation focused on offsetting rev's carbon emissions via the seagrass grow programme, and on providing grantmaking assistance for science residents on board the rev ocean vessel working to develop solutions for ocean acidification and plastic pollution.
building on the foundations dialogue, unesco’s ioc will continue to mobilize the philanthropic sector to design a fit-for-purpose ocean decade in which foundations play a critical role in setting priorities for resource mobilization and fostering partnerships for financing scientific innovation. foundations will also be invited to join the ocean decade alliance at a high-level launch event during the un 2020 ocean conference (lisbon, 2-6 june).
*list of attending foundations available here.
the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030) (the ocean decade) will bring together scientists and stakeholders from all relevant sectors to generate the scientific knowledge and to develop the partnerships needed for informing policies to support a well-functioning, productive, resilient, and sustainable ocean. the decade will enable the delivery of timely information about the state of the ocean and articulate development-dependent scenarios and a sustainable pathway into the future. the design and preparatory phase for the ocean decade are coordinated by the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco, by request of the united nations general assembly.
the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco (ioc-unesco), established in 1960 as a body with functional autonomy within unesco, is the only competent organization for marine science within the un system. the purpose of the commission is to promote international cooperation and to coordinate programmes in research, services and capacity-building, in order to learn more about the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas and to apply that knowledge for the improvement of management, sustainable development, the protection of the marine environment, and the decision-making processes of its member states. in addition, ioc is recognized through the united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos) as the competent international organization in the fields of marine scientific research (part xiii) and transfer of marine technology (part xiv).

overall, the experts identified some needs to be addressed by the obps in order to enhance its support to the global ocean observing community. these range from improved interoperability among different ocean observations and data management systems to the development of new training activities – in particular remote and virtual learning; from effectively engaging multiple cultures – including indigenuous languages – to increasing collaboration among existing initiatives and define the role of ocean best practices in support of the upcoming un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030, the “ocean decade” for short). 
other key areas for improvement were identified, including:
obps infrastructure: improve user experience, including the interface; and implement a best pactices convergence process to make sharing of protocols, samples, data, and code more effective.
capacity development: create dedicated training packages for specific groups, online training courses for indigenuous communities, activities aimed at developing capacities of professionals working in the blue economy and align these acitivities with the ocean decade actions.
potential for collaboration and partnerships: a diverse group of stakeholders should be further integrated into the obps, including early career ocean professionals (ecops), the fisheries sector, and experts in the areas of ethics – for ethical issues related to research activities, marine litter, sargassum research and management, surface radiation, among others. future developments of opbs should also open to non-scientific stakeholders.
the whole set of recommendations from the workshop will be submitted to the obps steering committee for resolution.

at this difficult time, please allow me to address you from the unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission. above all, on behalf of ioc, let me wish you and your loved ones good health as we go through this pandemic.
 
ioc’s current priority is to contribute, as we can, to preventing the spread of the virus everywhere where our staff are located around the globe, to help health systems and heroic medical staff to cope with the pandemic, and to support vulnerable people.
for that we are working remotely, all over the world. many meetings will now be conducted in a virtual environment. in continuing our work, we recognize significant constraints placed on each of us, our families, and on our co-workers.
nevertheless, our work and planning continue. the initial draft implementation plan for the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development is now available for the first peer review. for news on decade, please see http://oceandecade.org.  ioc chair ariel troisi is considering how to best convene the 53rd session ioc executive council. we will approach member states soon. ioc real time services, like tsunami warnings, remain operational. two recent cases of potentially damaging tsunami have been recently detected. please follow the ioc news via our social media channels or via our website (http://ioc.unesco.org). 
 
a billion people around the world are confined to their homes. patients require oxygen. let us think for a moment about them and thank the ocean for giving us more than half of the oxygen we breathe. please inspire and be inspired by thinking about the ocean. “one planet, one ocean.” while observing social distancing, we are becoming more united and caring about others. and this is why we will overcome the crisis, hopefully sooner than later. 
 
once again, please take care and stay healthy,

after an introduction by ioc’s executive secretary, vladimir ryabinin, the meeting addressed the covid-19 impacts and ioc responses across three of its main working areas: early warning and services, ocean research, and observing system and data management.
for tsunami early warning systems, ms alison brome (caribbean tsunami information centre, ctic, based in barbados) reassured all governments that ioc’s global coordination of tsunami warnings is being adjusted to the situation and is progressing towards contributing to multi-hazard warnings and disaster response taking into account the covid-19 context.
speaking about ocean research, ms kirsten isensee (ocean science section) announced a study to be published in 6-12 months on the impacts of covid-19 on the funding situation for ocean science, including infrastructure and human resources. looking ahead, the third edition of ioc’s flagship global ocean science report will be able to assess long-term impacts of this pandemic globally on investments in ocean science and the implementation of relevant elements of the un sustainable development goal 14 on the ocean.
on ocean observations and data management, mr albert fischer (director of the ioc-sponsored global ocean observing system) highlighted that covid-19 is likely to create a disruption in ocean observing as personnel are confined around the world, ships are called back to port, and autonomous observing instruments could degrade due to lack of maintenance. ioc is designing a platform to reduce impact through cooperative actions.
beyond these three areas of impact, alison clausen (marine policy section) informed delegates about preparations for the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development, set to start in january 2021. despite the covid-19 challenge, all decade processes are advancing, including the review of the draft implementation plan (currently ongoing), final consultations within the un system, the development of a global communications campaign and a series of virtual webinars and stakeholder engagement events.
the ioc executive secretary also presented to delegations proposed arrangements for decision making in relation to the potential postponement of the forthcoming 53rd session of the ioc executive council. 
engaging the sailing community through imoca
the partnership agreement signed with the imoca class on 31st january featured as one of the highlights of the discussion related to ocean observations and data management.
in a short video, five sailors of the imoca class from five different nationalities underlined the sailing world’s support for the scientific work done by unesco’s ioc. from the confinement of their homes, they shared positive messages about their commitment to science at sea. in their testimonials, these sailors already well accustomed to the solitude at sea, talked about the ocean they love and how they are contributing to a better understanding of the ocean through measuring human impacts in remote areas of the southern seas.
these skippers see first-hand the impact humanity is having on the ocean as they push their limits in the most isolated regions of the planet. this gives some of them a deep motivation to contribute to the work of researchers in the fields of ocean and climate observation.
imoca and unesco's intergovernmental oceanographic commission (through jcommops, which internationally coordinates and monitors the global in situ ocean observing system) are working tirelessly to mobilize scientists and mariners, in the context of near-global containment rules, to ensure that ocean observations and the wealth of knowledge they can bring to policy-makers remain at the top of the political agenda during the next decade of ocean sciences for sustainable development (2021-2030).

since 1965, 1,442 unique species have been detected outside of their native habitats across 49 global aquatic ecosystems – approximately one new detection every 8.4 days.
this synthesis highlights the magnitude of recent ans detections, but the real numbers may well above those recorded by scientists. many ans go unreported due to limited search effort and diminishing taxonomic expertise.

the 1,442 unique species recorded in the study is more than ten-fold lower than the number of non-indigenous species observed in terrestrial ecosystems. this can be partly explained by the fact that  land biodiversity is vastly higher than the combined diversity of  marine and freshwater ecosystems, and thus more non-indigenous species would be proportionally expected in terrestrial systems. however, the truth remains that the documentation of the diversity of invasions in marine, estuarine and freshwater habitats has significantly lagged behind similar research on land.
“we suspect that we may be at the tip of an invasion iceberg in understanding the scale of introductions in coastal environments”

the introduction of species across biogeographic barriers by human activities is recognized as one of the major drivers of biodiversity change. global warming has enabled non-indigenous species to expand into regions where previously they were not able to survive and reproduce, thus making it even more urgent for conservation policy and management to take urgent action to prevent new introductions and further spread of these species.
studies such as this one, based on national and regional inventories of non-indigenous species, are only reliable if local experts can maintain and continually update lists of new records. it will be fundamental to continue and to expand research and survey efforts across aquatic ecosystems (marine, estuarine and large freshwater ecosystems), including by implementing standardized methods across regions and taxa to better inform both regional and global policy development and management activities.

about the authors
the ices-ioc-imo working group on ballast and other ship vectors (wgbosv) and the ices working group on introduction and transfers of marine organisms (wgitmo) enjoy a very close working relationship. for nearly 20 years, the groups have met jointly during one of the three days of their respective annual meetings to discuss new research findings, share ideas, and develop future collaborations.  these two international working groups are composed of scientists – with extensive knowledge of ship-mediated biological invasions – who strive to advance the scientific understanding needed to guide management and policy decisions. currently, they collaborate on two shared terms of reference: the introduction and transfer of biofouling organisms through ship vectors, as well as climate change impacts on the establishment and spread of ship-mediated nonindigenous species, particularly as they relate to the arctic.
related content: ioc work on invasive species
in the future, it is expected that molecular methods will support the rapid and standardized detection of threats from invasive species. the analysis of dna in the environment can be used to identify the species present at each location through sequence analysis and comparisons to reference databases, without the need for extensive morphological identification. the ioc is active in developing the use of new molecular methods to monitor invasive species in the pacific with the pacman (pacific islands marine bioinvasions alert network) project. through this 3-year project an invasive species monitoring plan will be established in fiji, that will enable the rapid surveying of local marine biodiversity in risk areas for the purpose of identifying threats from invasive organisms. this project will provide environmental managers with a decision support tool, as well as a standardized data management system, that could be easily adapted to other regions. though care is needed in the development of molecular based methods due to errors in sequence identification, these methods could ultimately provide a new way to follow the spread of invasive species at the global level.",2021-04-16

the action platform for sustainable ocean business of the un global compact will play a key role in mobilizing the private sector in the upcoming ocean decade, which is scheduled to start in january 2021. the decade will offer a unique opportunity for the private sector and science to work together to increase ocean knowledge and shape it into sustainable solutions for society’s 21st century challenges, from climate change to food security. 
together, the un agencies will continue to foster science-industry collaboration for a sustainable and thriving blue economy. rapid declines in ocean health and marine ecosystems underscore the urgent need to intensify collaboration. advancing science-based ocean business is essential to balance the need for a clean, healthy and productive ocean with the strong growth in ocean industries required to achieve the global goals.
vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of unesco’s ioc, welcomed the new partnership as key to delivering on the decade’s promises of inclusivity: “as a collaborative framework, the ocean decade will be uniquely positioned to convene stakeholders from scientific disciplines and ocean industries to work together, leverage expertise and resources, as well as accelerate ocean knowledge creation and the implementation of impactful solutions. the un global compact will play a key role in bringing the private sector voice into the decade framework of action to deliver the ocean we want.""
sturla henriksen, un global compact special advisor, ocean, said: “put simply. better ocean science and stronger science-industry collaboration has numerous benefits for both the planet and the private sector, ranging from cost savings to predictable, stable supply chains and increased market shares. we are delighted to formalize our commitment to science-based ocean business and to the ocean decade”.
unesco’s ioc and the un global compact recently published the report advancing science for sustainable ocean business, clearly outlining the opportunities for the private sector to support the ocean decade’s objectives. the un global compact has also identified key opportunities for science-industry collaboration in a new report released today, the blue resilience brief, which outlines areas where scaling-up joint science-industry action could enhance the resilience of three blue economy areas and contribute towards a more sustainable future.
the letter of intent between the two organizations foresees joint activities around multiple axes of cooperation to facilitate science-industry participation in the decade, co-organize and deliver interactive dialogues and business networking events, foster industry participation in data sharing and ocean management activities, and stimulate innovation ecosystems for accelerating science-based solutions to deliver the ocean we want by 2030.

through the proclamation by the un general assembly of 2021 to 2030 a decade of ocean science for sustainable development, the intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) hopes to put in motion an extraordinary amount of action as well as collaborative research to develop the ocean science that could fully support countries to achieve the ocean everybody – we – want, that is, a clean, healthy, resilient, productive, predicted, safe, accessible, and inspiring and engaging, ocean.
central to the ocean decade is the transformation of ocean science into solution-orientated research that responds to existing and emerging societal needs. and central to that transformation is the notion of co-design and co-delivery: reaching across and actively seeking collaboration between different disciplines and communities of knowledge, and designing and delivering through innovative and sustainable partnerships.
convened by the ioc sub-commission for the western pacific (westpac) in cooperation with partners from national governments, research and academic institutions, industry, and international organizations or programmes, panelists and participants at the regional dialogue explored the region’s opportunities and challenges, best practices and lessons learned, as well as recommendations, for a co-designed and co-delivered ocean science that could respond to the needs for sustainable development in the region.
the most densely populated region with the highest level of marine biodiversity in the world, the western pacific and adjacent areas hold a vital social, economic, and cultural importance in humans’ livelihood and prosperity, not only among those living in the region, but in the whole world. “the un ocean decade offers a grand opportunity for this region to accelerate the development of ocean science solutions to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development,” remarked wenxi zhu, ioc-westpac head of office.
the realization of an ocean science that provides solutions to sustainability challenges, according to the session’s panelists, is hampered by, among others: low priority accorded to ocean research in the national development agenda; weak cross-discipline/sector collaborations; inadequate consideration of indigenous knowledge; lack of a strong connection between researchers and knowledge users; limited funding for ocean research, and constraints on the conduct of ocean research in coastal states’ exclusive economic zones. in addition, there is a growing recognition that the younger generation in some developing countries are less inclined and less supported to cultivate a career in ocean science.
“engage younger generations,” advised university of tokyo’s makino mitsutaku, one of the panelists. “diversity is not an obstacle; it’s a source of richness, of innovation.
the quest for co-designed solution-orientated research, among other ‘decade actions,’ has commenced with the publication of the first call for decade actions, on october 15, 2020. individuals, organizations, or institutions are called upon to put forward, before january 15, 2021, their decade actions, either in the form of large-scale transformative decade programme, or contributions of in-kind or financial resources.
the sub-commission, together with ioc member states and partners in the region, will hold a un ocean decade regional kickoff conference scheduled for august 2021 in bangkok, thailand. it will be held in conjunction with the 11th westpac international marine science conference.

professional skippers competing in some of the most famous yachting races (route du rhum, monaco globe series, the vendée globe) are taking action to protect their vast, endangered playground by partnering with scientific institutions for the monitoring of the ocean.
on 31 january, unesco and the international monohull open class association (imoca class) signed a two-year partnership agreement to jointly support marine scientific research and to raise awareness about the importance of science for the protection of the ocean and the sustainable use of marine resources. the activities will be coordinated by a joint centre for oceanographic and marine meteorological observing programme support (jcommops) – a collaboration between unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) and the world meteorological organization (wmo) – which internationally coordinates about 10,000 in situ ocean observing instruments for the continuous monitoring of the global ocean and the atmosphere above it.
“our skippers each share a variety of unique experiences; navigating to the most isolated corners of the globe whilst witnessing first-hand our impact on the world’s oceans. as a result, the imoca class understands the urgent need to protect and preserve our seas, making our work with unesco even more valuable”, expressed the imoca class in a statement.
besides floating icebergs, the proliferation of sargassum is making it hard for skippers to navigate across the caribbean sea. “compared to 20-25 years ago, navigation routes have been modified to adapt to these changes in the ocean. now it’s the time to act to limit the dangerous consequences of climate change on our shared ocean” explains stéphane le diraison, skipper of time for oceans.
ever since 2010, racing teams have started taking oceanographic instrumentation on board to help scientists get essential data on ocean temperature, salinity and co2 levels even in the most remote areas of the planet.
“the ocean is my playground. i want to protect it, this is why i decided to support science” argues alexia barrier, 4myplanet. back in october 2019, barrier and co-skipper joan mulloy deployed an argo float off the bay of biscay, during the jacques vabre transatlantic yacht race from normandy to brazil. during the same race, boris herrmann and will harris on board of malizia ii yacht club de monaco, le diraison and françois guiffant on board time for oceans, and fabrice amedeo and eric péron of newrest-art & fenêtres deployed two weather drifter floats and an oceanographic sensor capable of measuring levels of co2, salinity and surface temperature.
the scientific programme will be backed by educational activities, such as the participation in the campus unesco on the topic of ocean science, a half-day event with schools that aims at raising awareness of the role that each one of us plays in the protection of our planet.
“we believe that educating our children means educating the wider society. kids have a fantastic influence on their families”, explains herrmann, who guides children through the discovery of the ocean in an illustrated book distributed by his team malizia to schools across europe.
in the words of dr. vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission: “everyone has his or her role in the journey to a sustainable ocean, sometimes in distant and less accessible parts of the ocean. the sailing boats of the imoca class will be special contributors to ocean observations, helping to collect crucial ocean data”.

new zealand foreign affairs minister winston peters and civil defence minister peeni henare have announced the deployment of a network of dart (deep-ocean assessment and reporting of tsunami) buoys to safeguard the country’s coast against tsunami risk.
dart (deep-ocean assessment and reporting of tsunami) buoys are deep-ocean instruments that monitor changes in sea level. they are currently the only accurate way to rapidly confirm a tsunami has been generated before it reaches the coast. this is about keeping people safe by giving advance notice that a tsunami is heading our way. this is particularly critical for unfelt earthquakes originating from the kermadec trench. early detection of a tsunami using dart buoys allows new zealand to accurately provide early warnings using a range of communication channels including emergency mobile alerts.
“new zealand and the pacific region are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. it is vital we have adequate warning systems in place,” said mr peters. new zealand faces significant life-threatening tsunami risk. new zealand’s geographical and geological place in the pacific, puts the country at risk from many different tsunami sources, some may be generated and arrive at the nearest coasts in less than an hour.
“dart buoys are the only tried and repeatedly tested technology that confirms the generation of tsunami waves before they reach the coast. this is particularly critical for unfelt earthquakes originating from the kermadec trench. we have invested in the best equipment to keep new zealanders safe. until now, new zealand has been reliant on a single, aging dart buoy. this is a shocking inadequacy that we have addressed with urgency.” said mr peters.
the national geohazards monitoring centre will support the 24/7 monitoring to receive, process and analyse the data from the buoys, and the national emergency management agency will issue tsunami warnings and advisories to the new zealand public.
“we are establishing a network of fifteen dart buoys to provide early detection and support warnings for tsunami generated from the kermadec and hikurangi trenches right on our doorstep,” further emphasized mr henare. “this is about saving lives – people are at the heart of what we do.”
the dart buoy network will also provide tsunami monitoring and detection information for pacific countries, including tokelau, niue, the cook islands, tonga and samoa. the international sharing of information and the coordination of preparedness materials and exercises is conducted under the aegis of the pacific tsunami warning system, coordinated by unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc).
from seafloor to tsunami warning: step-by-step process (new zealand example)
an event that could trigger a tsunami such as a large undersea earthquake or undersea volcanic eruption occurs.
if a tsunami is generated, there are rapid and unusual changes to the water pressure on the sea floor.
the dart buoy’s sensor on the ocean floor measures water pressure.
the measurements are sent by acoustic signal to a buoy on the surface.
the buoy sends the signal to a satellite.
the signal is sent to the 24/7 national geohazards monitoring centre at gns science.
gns science geohazards analysts analyse the data.
if a tsunami has been detected the geohazard analyst will notify the national emergency management agency, the official tsunami warning agency for new zealand.
the national emergency management agency will issue a tsunami warning to cdem groups, emergency services, media and to the public.

								Date: 2 December 2020","https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=21804#.X8kR2GhKiMo, https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2020-track-be-one-of-three-warmest-years-record&nbsp, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","climate change continued its relentless march in 2020, which is on track to be one of the three warmest years on record. 2011-2020 will be the warmest decade on record, with the warmest six years all being since 2015, according to the world meteorological organization.
ocean heat is at record levels and more than 80% of the global ocean experienced a marine heatwave at some time in 2020, with widespread repercussions for marine ecosystems already suffering from more acidic waters due to carbon dioxide (co2) absorption, according to the provisional wmo report on the state of the global climate in 2020.
the report, which is based on contributions of dozens of international organizations and experts*, shows how high-impact events including extreme heat, wildfires and floods, as well as the record-breaking atlantic hurricane season, affected millions of people, compounding threats to human health and security and economic stability posed by the covid-19 pandemic.
despite the covid-19 lockdown, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continued to rise, committing the planet to further warming for many generations to come because of the long lifetime of co2 in the atmosphere, according to the report.
the global mean temperature for january to october 2020 was around 1.2°c above the 1850–1900 baseline, used as an approximation of pre-industrial levels. 2020 is very likely to be one of the three warmest years on record globally. modern temperature records began in 1850.
the wmo assessment is based on five global temperature datasets (figure below). all five of those datasets currently place 2020 as the 2nd warmest for the year to date, following 2016 and ahead of 2019. the difference between the warmest three years is small, however, and exact rankings for each data set could change once data for the entire year are available.
the most notable warmth was observed across northern asia, particularly the siberian arctic, where temperatures were more than 5 °c above average.  siberian heat culminated in late june, when it reached 38.0 °c at verkhoyansk on the 20th, provisionally the highest known temperature anywhere north of the arctic circle. this fuelled the most active wildfire season in an 18-year long data record, as estimated in terms of co2 emissions released from fires.





global annual mean temperature difference from preindustrial conditions (1850–1900). the two reanalyses (era5 and jra-55) are aligned with the in situ datasets (hadcrut, noaaglobaltemp and gistemp) over the reference period 1981–2010. data for 2020 are from january to october.
sea-level rise and ocean heat
ocean heat content for 2019 was highest on record in the datasets going back to 1960. there is a clear signal for faster heat uptake in recent decades. more than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean.
on average, since early 1993, the altimetry-based global mean rate of sea level rise amounts to 3.3 ± 0.3 mm/yr. the rate has also increased over that time. a greater loss of ice mass from the ice sheets is the main cause of the accelerated rise in the global mean sea level.
global mean sea-level in 2020 is similar to that in 2019, and consistent with the long-term trend. developing la niña conditions have led to a recent small drop in global sea level, similar to the temporary drops associated with previous la niña events. 
as with heatwaves on land, extreme heat can affect the near-surface layer of the oceans with a range of consequences for marine life and dependent communities. satellite retrievals of sea-surface temperature are used to monitor marine heatwaves, which can be categorized as moderate, strong, severe or extreme. much of the ocean experienced at least one 'strong' marine heatwave at some point in 2020. the laptev sea experienced an extreme marine heatwave from june to october. sea ice extent was unusually low in the region and adjacent land areas experienced heatwaves during the summer.
ocean acidification is increasing. the ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic co2 from the atmosphere, thereby helping to alleviate the impacts of climate change on the planet. the ecological costs of this process to the ocean are high, as the co2 reacts with seawater lowering its ph; a process known as ocean acidification. there is decline in average ph at the available observing sites between 2015 and 2019, the last year for which data are currently available. a wider variety of sources including measurements of other variables shows also a steady increase in the global ocean acidification.

lessons and opportunities for enhancing climate action
according to international monetary fund, the current global recession caused by the covid-19 pandemic makes it challenging to enact the policies needed for mitigation, but it also presents opportunities to set the economy on a greener path in order to boost investment in green and resilient public infrastructure, thus supporting gdp and employment during the recovery phase.

in this context, the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco and european commission’s directorate-general for maritime affairs and fisheries adopted in march 2017 a joint roadmap to accelerate maritime/marine spatial planning processes worldwide (msproadmap), which has two main objectives at regional level:
strengthen institutional capacities in relation to marine spatial planning (msp) and the sustainable blue economy;
strengthen institutional coordination for the adoption of a roadmap.
with the support of sweden, as well as national and regional authorities and partners, a series of online and face-to-face events took place throughout the months of october and november 2020 to build collective capacities to respond to emerging ocean issues, facilitate exchanges among public and private stakeholders, and formulate recommendations for the development of msp and the sustainable blue economy in each country/region.
the activities involved officials, technicians and experts, representatives of maritime sectors, local stakeholders and civil society:
technical workshops on environmental pressures, cumulative impacts and tools to support decision-making in africa: exchange good practices and lessons learned to tackle environmental challenges associated with the implementation of msp in the region;
trainings on msp and sustainable blue economy: take stock of existing initiatives and processes at national scale and explore future opportunities and perspectives.

by building on the outcomes of the recent sargassum international conference (guadeloupe, october 2019), the series of webinars will present key challenges and responses to sargassum tides in the caribbean and west africa, highlighting the potential for international cooperation. regional initiatives such as those carried out by iocaribe will also be engaged in the sessions to provide a regional perspective.
the first webinar was held on tuesday, 26 may and at least 3 more will follow over the remainder of 2020, leading up to a an open science meeting on sargassum to be held in mexico in 2021 and to the fifth united nations environment assembly (unea-5) in february 2021.

ioc: key player in integrated ocean management
unesco’s ioc has played a leading role in advancing science-based approaches to support the conceptualization, design and implementation of integrated ocean management at national, regional and global scales since the early 2000s. the 2009 publication “marine spatial planning (msp) guide: a step-by-step approach toward ecosystem-based management” was among the first international integrated ocean management guidelines to be published, and soon became an internationally recognized standard for countries wishing to engage in integrated ocean management through the msp methodology.
today ioc holds a robust portfolio of past and ongoing activities focused around strengthening msp as a methodological and policy integrated management tool, and developing ecosystem-based management of large marine ecosystems.
through the mspglobal initiative, co-led with the directorate-general for maritime affairs and fisheries of the european commission (dg mare), the ioc provides the context for active and effective participation of policy makers, private and public stakeholders, scientists and citizens to develop institutional, technical and human capacities on msp at national and transboundary level. since its launch in november 2018, mspglobal has been implementing a demand-driven multilingual training programme in cooperation with other un agencies, member states and regional partners, taking into account regional and local socio-cultural contexts and needs. to date, mspglobal has held a dozen courses with over 450 country officials from all continents, organized four international forums on msp with about 700 participants, and hosted over 1,000 participants from more than 65 countries over a series of msp thematic virtual events. ioc and dg mare have now embarked on the development of international guidance for msp implementation in cross-border and transboundary areas, to be finalized in 2021.
ioc has also been actively working to promote ecosystem-based management through the large marine ecosystems (lme) governance framework since the 1990s. lmes are large rich and highly productive areas near the coast, often spreading across political borders, and requiring governance frameworks. together with the u.s. national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa), the international union for the conservation of nature (iucn), the united nations development programme (undp), and others, ioc has promoted the lme approach both from a conceptual and scientific point of view, contributing on the ground to the formulation and implementation of projects financed by the global environment facility (gef) in various regions.
lme projects contribute to delivering healthier ocean ecosystems and sustained ecosystem services – one of ioc’s main strategic objectives – and have recently been engaged in the preparations of the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development by focusing on the need for more science in ocean governance.
“keeping the ocean running for the health and well-being of people and for sustainability. this is what we're trying to achieve in the course of the decade,” reminded ioc’s executive secretary vladimir ryabinin, speaking at a panel on linking large marine ecosystems to local science and management for sustainable development (20 may 2020) as part of a global ocean series of virtual panels organized by the partner organizations behind the ioc-executed gef project iw:learn.
dr ryabinin emphasized that “we need to move from the current state of the ocean to a managed state of the ocean. integrated ocean management is the key approach here. and we can implement this through maritime spatial planning, effective marine protected areas and capitalizing on the large marine ecosystems concept.”
integrated ocean management into the ocean decade
the high level panel blue paper 14 indicated that “the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021–2030) could be a suitable process and platform to accelerate the development and use of ocean science for integrated ocean management,” mobilizing investments and engagement not only to foster new science but also to integrate existing and historical scientific data, and incorporate traditional knowledge into decision-making processes.
the decade will provide a ‘once in a lifetime’ opportunity to create a new foundation, across the science-policy interface, to strengthen management of the ocean through the development of innovative scientific applications in areas of marine conservation, pollution reduction, sustainable food production, coastal protection and access to information and knowledge, to name a few. the decade is embracing a participative and transformative process so that scientists, policy makers, managers, and service users can work together to ensure that ocean science delivers greater benefits for both the ocean ecosystem and for society.
organised around a set of societal outcomes addressing ocean health, resilience and sustainable economic development, the decade will harness science and technologies through multi-stakeholder partnerships at different scales, hence providing the knowledge base for strengthening integrated ocean management globally.
after a preparatory phase featuring global and regional consultations about priorities for the decade of ocean science, the ioc’s decade focal point and head of marine policy julian barbière argues that “the next [implementation] phase is really about communities moving forward and proposing co-designed actions for the decade so that we can collectively get those regional, national, local efforts to build on each other and help achieve our global objectives.”
the high level panel for a sustainable ocean economy
established in september 2018 as a unique global initiative of 14 serving heads of state and government, representing 30% of the world’s coastlines, the ocean panel is working with government, business, financial institutions, the science community and civil society to develop a transformative action agenda that recognizes the need for a new relationship between humanity and the ocean and the rapid transition to a sustainable ocean economy. panel members include serving world leaders from australia, canada, chile, fiji, ghana, indonesia, jamaica, japan, kenya, mexico, namibia, norway, palau and portugal.
in the spirit of achieving the un sustainable development goals (sdgs) and building momentum toward the un decade of ocean science, the ocean panel convened an expert group and commissioned a series of blue papers, with release dates between november 2019 and october 2020, meant to provide thematic deep dives on a range of topics and offer a robust, fact base to inform a new, independent ocean report and the ocean panel’s final recommendations.

during the course of the last century, two major earthquakes that triggered destructive tsunamis hit the two countries: the 1906 ecuador-colombia earthquake (mw 8.8 of magnitude) and the 1979 tumaco earthquake (mw 8.2 of magnitude).
more recently, on 16 april 16 2016, a mw 7.8 earthquake hit again the coast of ecuador, killing more than 600 people. a tsunami alert was issued by the noaa pacific tsunami warning center for colombia, costa rica, ecuador, fiji, panama and peru.
tsunami early warning is critical to protecting lives in the aftermath of an earthquake. to strengthen national preparedness to the risk of tsunami, the government of ecuador and unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) – which have a long-standing technical cooperation in place in this area – organized an expert meeting on 27-29 january in guayaquil, on the ecuadorian coast. the meeting focused on tsunami sources, hazards, risk and associated uncertainties along the colombia-ecuador border.
experts in the fields of seismology, geology, geodesy, sea level monitoring, sedimentology, tectonics, tsunami modelling, paleo-seismology and paleo-tsunami were consulted during the meeting in order to develop and explore potential tsunami hazard and credible scenarios for the area.
a significant part of the meeting was also dedicated to explore current research projects and potential collaborations. the commitment of all participants allowed for fruitful discussions whereby modelled tsunami inundation scenarios were brainstormed and visualized.
high importance was placed on the engagement of local communities: representatives from the local gobiernos autónomos descentralizados (gad) were invited to take part into a public awareness event hosted by the oceanographic institute of the ecuadorian navy (inocar) at the navy officers’ club in guayaquil as part of the official programme of the meeting.

the aim of the guide is to complement the intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc) and unesco’s marine spatial planning: a step-by-step approach toward ecosystem-based management, which presents various examples of alternative financing mechanisms and stakeholder engagement that msp teams can use to develop their own strategies.
through concrete examples, communicating msp describes how open and engaging communication on msp can help achieve the main objective of ensuring that the largest number of stakeholders are allowed to perform their activities in a fair, sustainable, and collaborative way.
the guide presents how msp is highly benefitting from cooperation, communication opportunities and tools enabling knowledge exchange from a number of key initiatives, such as the mspglobal initiative. in this framework, the international mspforum provides a space for participants to build on the knowledge acquired through thematic panels and technical workshops, to promote open collaboration on msp in their own countries and, in turn, to form an engaged and active stakeholder community.
the guide also underlines the key role played by projects. for example, project marsp is committed to the development of maritime spatial planning principles in the macaronesian region (madeira, azores, canary islands). via short, inexpensive and explanatory videos, the project shows msp stakeholders in their “natural environment” explaining what msp is and what it means for them, with a direct and personal style appealing to a wider audience.
communicating msp actively contributes to advancing the blue economy and, ultimately, fulfils the vision of a shared maritime space for all.
participative processes, event planning, social media, interactive screens or virtual reality can all support the coexistence between human activities and the protection of ecosystem services.
communicating msp is available on the eu bookshop.

as to the iode workplan, the meeting reviewed progress of the 15 iode global projects and 6 regional programmes. where necessary the management group made recommendations for improvements and remedial action. the management group also noted the three new extra-budgetary projects: (i) ocean infohub (oih) ; (ii) oceanteacher global academy phase 2; and (iii) pacific islands marine bio invasions alert network (pacman) and thanked the government of flanders (kingdom of belgium) for funding these important new initiatives that will contribute to and enhance the iode capacity development activities. in addition the management group noted the proposal for a new project: aquadocs - to replace oceandocs.
regarding the upcoming iode-xxvi meeting, the management group decided that this will take place from 20 to 23 april 2021 fully online. due to the covid-19 pandemic, it is currently not possible to have this meeting face to face in sopot, poland as planned.
the management group also discussed the contributions of the iode to the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development. iode organized two online workshops in 2020: (i) workshop on data sharing between un agencies as a contribution to the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (20 april 2020); and (ii) international data sharing workshop for non-un igos, global and regional organisations and projects, ngos and private sector (12 october 2020). the main objectives of these two events were: (i) to organize a meet-and-greet for the invited organizations so they can familiarize themselves with iode; (ii) to invite the participating organizations to join the iwg-sodis; (iii) to invite the participating organizations to provide input to odiscat; and (iv) to invite the participating organizations to collaborate on ocean data sharing under the un ocean decade umbrella.

after the approval of the implementation plan of the decade and its chapter entitled “data, information and digital knowledge management” the decade coordination unit at the ioc secretariat has invited iode to work on the development of a “decade data strategy”.
regarding the preparations for the first international ocean data conference it was agreed - together with the host country, poland - that the event will take place in november 2021 (date to be confirmed). this event could be the first of a series of biannual major conferences on ocean data and information.

								Date: 4 May 2020","https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373327, https://en.unesco.org/themes/119665/news, https://en.unesco.org/, https://www.facebook.com/IocUnesco/, https://twitter.com/iocunesco/, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuYED1WVJIOk5Zhs0TWOrDSqcWvRP9lI, https://www.linkedin.com/company/ioc-unesco/, https://www.flickr.com/people/143400023@N08/, https://www.instagram.com/ioc_unesco/, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/disclaimer, https://en.unesco.org/this-site/access-to-information-policy","historical tide measurements are among the oldest direct observations that provide relevant information on the evolution of mean sea level in the long term. in many countries, systematic sea level observations have been carried out since the early to mid-1800s. despite this rich historical legacy, documents with these records are hidden in archive centers, which, as all paper documents, are at risk of suddenly going missing.
there can be considerable benefit in rescuing these data before they may be lost. as quoted by ed hawkins, climate scientist at the university of reading, uk, “the fastest way to collect new weather observations is by looking back in time!"".
recovery of historical sea level measurements can contribute to assessing mean sea level trends on multi-decadal to secular timescales. historical observations can be used to improve estimation and prediction of extreme water levels and are thus vital to coastal management in the context of global climate change.
the global sea level observing system (gloss) of unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission has long advocated for the rescue and inventory of historical sea level data. although individual projects and some concerted national campaigns have been carried out in recent years to respond to these appeals, a more sustained programmatic approach to cooperation in this field is needed at the international level.
the establishment of a data rescue working group will be the first key step of this new programmatic approach, allowing coordinating international efforts to recover vital sea level data – including, but not limited to mobilizing resources on a large scale for what is ultimately an enormous, time-consuming work.
the data rescue working group is the main outcome of the international workshop on sea level data archaeology, which was convened under the auspices of ioc-unesco and gloss on 10-12 march 2020 in paris, france. the tides, water level and currents working group (twcwg) of the international hydrographic organization (iho) and the international association for the physical sciences of the oceans of the international union of geodesy and geophysics (iapso/iugg) co-sponsored the workshop.
“ocean observations are essential to understanding and sustainably managing the ocean”, said vladimir ryabinin, executive secretary of unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission during his opening remarks. “workshops like this are an essential contribution towards the objectives of the united nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development and the world climate research programme grand challenge project on regional sea level change and coastal impacts” ryabinin added.
the sea level data archaeology workshop was organized in response to a recommendation by the joint meeting of the twcwg/iho and gloss (11-13 april 2019, busan, republic of korea).

born on 26 february 1930 in new hampshire, usa, art grew up with his two brothers and three sisters, helping his father run a small grocery store. these early years with such a large family earned him a remarkable work ethic and exquisite social skills.
art studied electrical engineering at the university of new hampshire (unh), where he was also known for his athletic skills. in 1951, he went to the massachusetts institute of technology to study meteorology and oceanography.
having participated in the unh reserve officers training corps (rotc) program, he joined the air force as forecaster, serving in japan for two years and then retiring in 1965 as captain.
upon return to the usa, art chose to further his studies in oceanography at the scripps institution of oceanography.
during his brilliant career, he served the us naval oceanographic office, nasa, the nsf and then noaa, where he became director of the sea grant program in 1978.
in 1985, he joined the ioc secretariat in paris, france to serve as coordinator of the world climate research programme, where he stayed until his retirement in 2002.
during his years at the ioc, art played a key role in developing the ocean observing system, by supporting first the ocean observing system development panel and then the ocean observations panel for climate.
after his retirement from ioc, art remained in france. through his 70s, he was skiing the alps and the pyrenees. in his 80s, he hiked the pyrenees and sang in a choral group, and for his 80th birthday, he hiked coast to coast across england for two weeks. even on his 90th birthday, he outdid his guests singing amazing grace with a big smile on his face. like most people, art had a few quirks: his favourite “baguettes tradition” had to be bought hot at a special store; caesar salad must include anchovies or be returned; each item placed in a suitcase must be ironed and folded before closing, and these were just a few.
on behalf of the ioc, we extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends, especially to his loving wife, jacqueline.",2021-04-16

such initiatives are in line with the un decade for ocean science for sustainable development and the recommendations of the citizen panel includes for the danish government to embrace the un decade objectives. the very serious condition of the sea dawned on the citizens and they will here share their concerns and recommendations to the politicians, which the politicians are asked to act on immediately.
prior to the conference, a panel of 14 citizens was selected to vary across gender, age, residence, education and interests. they were given a first introduction to the state of the danish marine environment. they formulated a series of questions about the state of the marine environment, the impact of human resource use and other activities on marine ecosystems and on potential solutions - questions which were then addressed by experts and stakeholders during the first two days of the conference. the citizens then formulated a joint document with their concerns and recommendations which they presented to politicians, media, experts and stakeholders in the danish parliament on the last day.
in the public consensus report “our sea” the citizen panel stress that the state of the marine environment is alarming, that we need to act, and that the societal costs may be big in the short term but will turn out as reasonable investments in the future. the panel also share the concern that despite the importance and urgency of the issue, citizens in general know very little about it. they call for educational, cultural and public service organizations to take on the important task of public communication about the marine environment in order to urge us all to take on responsibility. they concluded by inviting the audience to join the ocean decade and focus on its ten challenges. through the decade, inclusive tools such as ocean literacy and capacity-development were mentioned as necessary to transform ocean knowledge into actions over the next ten years.
these recommendations of the citizen panel will be carefully drawn up to a set of final recommendations to the danish government and other danish authorities for an effective agenda and actions for ocean governance. these outcomes of the conference will be presented during february 2021, taking into consideration that effective ocean stewardship requires the participation of all members of society in defining a common ocean future.",2021-04-16

“we must mobilize our efforts to improve community preparedness through scientific risk assessment, regular evacuation drills and local response plans. despite notable progress in this area, many challenges still lie ahead, as demonstrated by the two tsunamis that hit indonesia in 2018” said ms audrey azoulay, director-general of unesco, on the occasion of world tsunami awareness day.

tsunamis are no-notice, fast onset natural hazards that can cause catastrophic impacts. it is impossible to know when or where the next tsunami will hit, but we know that early warnings will save lives. for distant tsunamis, the tsunami service providers provide timely alerts to country national tsunami warning centres who evaluate their own tsunami threat and issue tsunami warnings to their coastal communities. and for local tsunamis, continuous education is essential so that everyone self-evacuates upon recognizing nature’s natural tsunami warnings. if people do not evacuate in time, thousands of lives will be lost and massive losses incurred that will have long lasting humanitarian, social and economic impacts.
the exercise, titled exercise pacific wave 2020 (pacwave20), will ensure that the communications system to officially alert countries of the pacific tsunami warning and mitigation system is working. it is the ninth such exercise with the first having been carried out in 2006, and subsequent exercises held in 2008, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.
featuring for pacwave20, the candidate tsunami service provider central american tsunami advisory centre (catac), hosted by nicaragua, will conduct the second regional tsunami drill for central america (guatemala, el salvador, honduras, nicaragua, costa rica and panama), that will take place on 11 november 2020 at 10 am (11 am in panama).
this exercise will simulate a strong tsunami caused by an earthquake with magnitude mw 7.8, caused off the gulf of fonseca in the pacific ocean of central america. this would result in a so-called ""slow"" earthquake that is characterized by generating little seismic shaking but large tsunamis. the disastrous tsunami of 1 september 1992 on the pacific coast of nicaragua and the dangerous tsunami of 26 august 2012 in el salvador and nicaragua had this misleading characteristic.
the exercise is sponsored by unesco’s intergovernmental oceanographic commission through its intergovernmental coordination group of the pacific tsunami warning and mitigation system (icg/ptws).

after 10 days of non-stop tremors and earthquakes, including a magnitude 5.8 event on one of the most important puerto rican holidays (3 kings day), people in southern puerto rico were violently awoken january 7, 2020 at 4:24 local time. an earthquake just offshore of magnitude 6.4 sent its powerful waves across the island. the last time something of this intensity and devastation happened was during the 11 october 1918 earthquake and tsunami. 
although the southern puerto rico earthquake could not be predicted in space and time, for over 30 years the scientific, engineering and emergency management community had been urging people and government to take more action to reduce our vulnerability. over and over again in local, national and international forums the need for greater understanding of the hazard and the corresponding preparedness and mitigation measures had been expressed. despite significant advances in earthquake and tsunami monitoring, an updated building code and improved awareness, the safety of buildings and catastrophe planning lagged behind. we were caught underprepared.
fortunately, in the days leading up to the main event, the government authorities and the people paid attention to the earths unsettling signs and put aside the holiday activities to inform and prepare for a possible large event. thanks to this proactive approach, the earthquake sequence left only one reported death.
images of a collapsed school and church as well as hundreds of destroyed homes and businesses circled the world, but that was not all. additional consequences included an island-wide power outage, thousands of displaced, significant delays in providing citizens with essential services, small business interruption, financial distress and a shutdown of public education.
in the wake of the damage and the ensuing weeks of non-stop aftershock activity, even those who may not have had any physical loss were anxious, nervous and fatigued. the emotional impact has affected the whole island. the fear of returning to homes in southern puerto rico has been intense, keeping thousands of peoples sleeping in formal and informal camps and outside their homes. several suicides and heart attacks have been reported. once the houses have been rebuilt, how much longer will it take puerto rico to reconstruct people’s well being?
within all this tragedy, people are also anxious about potential tsunamis. fortunately, as of 2016 all municipalities at risk of tsunami have been recognized by the us national weather service as tsunamiready®. given the strong groundshaking from the m 6.4 earthquake, a local tsunami advisory (indicating no inundation, but potential hazardous marine conditions) was issued, and one could hear the sirens sounding the evacuation for the hills. a small tsunami of just a couple of centimeters was detected within minutes at nearby sea level stations, the advisory was cancelled and the pacific tsunami warning center was able to reconfirm there was no tsunami threat. 
fortunately, to date we do not know of any injuries associated with the evacuation, but the experience from that day and the ensuing weeks has revealed vulnerabilities in our tsunami warning system, precisely many of the challenges that the tsunami community has proposed to address in the upcoming un decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030).
after the m 6.4 event and the likelihood, albeit very small, of a larger earthquake with greater tsunami potential, the questions flooded in. how would the impact of a tsunami from southern puerto rico differ from that on the evacuation maps? what was the possibility and the potential impact of submarine landslide? what actions, if any, needed to be taken by people on the other side of the island? are advisories and warnings not the same thing? how fast we will know there is a tsunami threat? how will we know a tsunami is coming if the sirens aren’t working?
these are important issues that the global tsunami community aims to tackle in the course of the next years, and surely by the end of the ocean decade in 2030. specifically, we must:
(1) address all sources of tsunamis: local and distant, whether generated by straightforward or complex earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides;
(2) integrate more observations into the early warning systems, not just seismic and sea level;
(3) fill the gaps in coastal and deep ocean bathymetry (the height of the ocean floor);
(4) generate computational power for faster and more effective forecasts;
(5) improve tsunami preparedness and mitigation in coastal communities. 
the ocean decade is a golden opportunity to ensure that our ocean threats, which challenge our predictive abilities with their fast onset, infrequency and devastating impact, are not forgotten before disaster strikes.
