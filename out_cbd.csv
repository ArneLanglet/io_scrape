but, for that framework to succeed, governments must ensure broad participation in its formal processes. non-state actors <U+0096> sub-national governments, business and the financial sector, academia, civil society, youth and indigenous peoples and local communities <U+0096> have a critical role to play in delivering biodiversity outcomes. 

there is no denying the urgency of the challenge. as the ipbes global assessment warned, an estimated one million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction. wwf<U+0092>s living planet report found that global wildlife is in freefall. 

the crisis in nature has direct impacts on human society and prosperity. as the world economic forum<U+0092>s nature risk rising report points out, more than half of the world<U+0092>s total gross domestic product, or $44 trillion, involves activities that are moderately or highly dependent on nature. meanwhile, the covid-19 pandemic, which has caused the greatest shock to the global economy since records began, has exposed our exposure to zoonotic diseases jumping from stressed animal populations, habitat and ecosystem loss. 

the report economics of biodiversity: the dasgupta review underlined the fact that nature is an asset. it can no longer be treated with no value, and thus continue to be degraded to the point where we remain more vulnerable and exposed to future pandemics.  

action to halt and reverse the crisis in nature is, at last, rising to the top of the international policy agenda. the rescheduled 15th meeting of the conference of the parties (cop-15) to the convention on biological diversity (cdb), due to take place in kunming, china, is expected to agree a successor to the aichi biodiversity targets. 

we are confident that governments at cop-15 are capable of building a collective, ambitious, measurable vision for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use that encourages transformational change. that vision must incorporate intermediate objectives and mechanisms to measure progress. it must recognise that this vision and its objectives are an essential element for people<U+0092>s livelihoods and sustainable development. it must ensure that this vision, and its objectives and mechanisms, are effectively mainstreamed into domestic policies.

the question is, how can this vision be realised?""

""in the face of this challenge [of the covid-19 pandemic], the post-2020 global biodiversity framework is our road map and its implementation a necessity for our survival. the next 10 years will be the most critical of our generation. without much more determined action, nature will be destroyed on an appalling scale, with ever greater environmental threats and climate-related impacts, including floods, storms, drought, desertification, food shortages, water scarcities, wildfires, sea level rise and depletion of the oceans. to avoid this nightmare future and realise instead the 2050 vision of living in harmony with nature, the nations of the world must deliver on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.

the parties to the convention on biological diversity recognise that protected and conserved areas are cornerstones of biodiversity conservation. they constitute important stocks of natural, cultural and social capital and yield economically valuable goods and services that benefit human populations. if they are to function well, they must be effectively managed and governed with inclusiveness, transparency and equity, and encourage the participation of indigenous peoples and local communities, and youth, among others.

there is some good news. we are on track to exceed aichi target 11 <U+0096> of 17 per cent of terrestrial areas under protection, and 10 per cent of marine and coastal waters. almost 20 million kilometers squared in protected land and sea areas have been added over the last decade. with coherent and concerted effort, globally agreed targets can be achieved.

the covid-19 pandemic taught us that by working together and in solidarity, we can end the pandemic, tackle its consequences and build resilience against future pandemics. we should transfer that lesson to the challenge of biodiversity by implementing the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

moving into the post-2020 period, we will need increased ambition and implementation, as well as a greater focus on protected area quality. by leading humanity away from its current destructive course, we can achieve the 2050 vision of living in harmony with nature. but that will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders: governments; global, regional and sub-regional organisations; nongovernmental organisations, civil society, the private sector, academia and others...""

global biodiversity outlook 5
the fifth global biodiversity outlook, the cbd<U+0092>s flagship report and the leading un report on biodiversity, provided a status report on action we need to take, where we stand, where we need to go, and how to get there, and outlined eight major transitions needed to slow, then halt nature<U+0092>s accelerating decline.

while the report found that none of the aichi biodiversity targets had been fully achieved, with only six targets being partially met, it also highlighted progress in several areas. in fact, where policy measures were in place, and where actions have been implemented, they delivered results. bright spots include extinctions prevented by conservation, more lands and oceans protected, and fish-stocks bouncing back in well-managed fisheries. policy measures do work. but we must do more.

theory of change of the framework

the post-2020 global biodiversity framework builds on the strategic plan for biodiversity 2011-2020 and sets out an ambitious plan to implement broad-based action to bring about a transformation in society<U+0092>s relationship with biodiversity and to ensure that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled. the framework aims to galvanize urgent and transformative action by governments and all of society, including indigenous peoples and local communities, civil society and businesses, to achieve the outcomes it sets out in its vision, mission, goals and targets, and thereby contribute to the objectives of the convention on biological diversity and other biodiversity related multilateral agreements, processes and instruments.

the framework<U+0092>s theory of change assumes that transformative actions are taken to: 

         (a) put in place tools and solutions for implementation and mainstreaming,

         (b) reduce the threats to biodiversity, and

         (c) ensure that biodiversity is used sustainably in order to meet people<U+0092>s needs and that these actions are supported by

                  (i) enabling conditions, and

                  (ii) adequate means of implementation, including financial resources, capacity and technology. 

  
the theory of change is complementary to and supportive of, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. it also takes into account the long-term strategies and targets of other multilateral environment agreements, including the biodiversity-related and rio conventions, to ensure synergistic delivery of benefits from all the agreements for the planet and people.

"17","Threats to inland water biodiversity are significant","https://www.cbd.int/waters/problem/","threats to inland water biodiversity are significant and likely to escalate as more water is used to meet human needs and the impacts of land-based activities degrade inland waters further.  the primary indirect drivers of change leading to the loss of inland waters biodiversity have been the growth of human populations, particularly in coastal areas, coupled with growing economic activity. human pressures on rapidly diminishing areas of inland water resources are increasingly compromising many of the ecosystem services crucial to human well-being.

the unsustainable use of water is a particularly important driver of biodiversity loss, particularly as there are significant competing demands placed on water and these are set to increase. agriculture accounts for about 70% of all water extracted from rivers. increased human use of fresh water has reduced the amount available to maintain the ecological character of many inland water ecosystems. over-harvesting of inland waters, including fisheries for food, recreation or trade, is also a major threat and leads to the decline of indigenous species' populations.

land use change is expected to continue to be a major driver of changes in the provision of ecosystem services up to 2050. global climate change is expected to exacerbate the loss and degradation of many wetlands and the loss or decline of their species and to harm the human populations dependent on their services. however, projections about the extent of such loss and degradation or decline are not yet well established.

at its first meeting, held in nairobi in august 2019, the open-ended working group (wg2020) requested the co-chairs and the executive secretary prepare a zero draft text of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework for consideration at its second meeting planned for 24-29 february 2020 in kunming, china. 

the zero draft document provides background information, an introduction to the zero draft and a draft recommendation for consideration by the second meeting of wg2020. two annexes comprise the zero draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and includes elements of a draft recommendation to the cop at its fifteenth meeting. the document is also complemented by two addendums, containing appendices to the draft post-2020 framework and a glossary of terms. 

the proposed framework applies a <U+0093>theory of change<U+0094> approach, a strategic planning framework used to help plan, implement and evaluate the impacts of the actions taken. this is a powerful tool for organizing measurable goals and solutions, and for evaluating both short- and long-term impacts in a consistent, meaningful and transparent structure. this will allow diverse stakeholders to articulate challenges, work together towards common goals, use the same language when sharing information on the status of implementation, and ensure that collective actions are aligned towards achieving the greatest possible impact. 

the zero draft also takes into account elements of guidance on goals, smart targets, indicators, baselines, and monitoring frameworks, relating to the drivers of biodiversity loss, for achieving transformational change, within the scope of the cbd<U+0092>s three objectives, discussed during the twenty-third meeting of the subsidiary body on scientific, technical and technological advice as well as the outcomes of the eleventh meeting of the ad hoc open-ended inter-sessional working group on article 8(j) and related provisions. it also includes a preliminary list of indicators that may be used to assess progress towards the goals and targets. furthermore, the proposed framework considers the various consultation processes that have taken place, including views expressed during the informal briefing by the co-chairs on 24 november 2019.

enb reports reach government ministers and officials, delegates to cbd<U+0092>s formal and informal events, ngos, the business community, and the media.  the tens of thousands of subscribers to enb are able to access information from cbd<U+0092>s meetings while comparing notes between our events and other key international sustainable development negotiations.  
given the many travel restrictions around the world, due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the reporting in the enb has been a particularly useful tool in keeping global audiences informed.
recently enb launched a new, more searchable website. this refreshed website now includes:

an improved search function that allows users to easily find country statements made during environmental negotiations over the past 28 years, and 
	an improved content management system that allows users to sort reports by topic, region, and negotiation process.
their expert research insights, commentary, and analysis on critical sustainability issues, complement the work of the secretariat of the convention on biological diversity.
in preparation for the negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the cbd is facilitating various opportunities for parties, other governments, and all relevant organizations and stakeholders to participate.  it is expected that participants in the cbd process will rely on scientific and technical advice, such as that provided in the fifth edition of the global biodiversity outlook.  enb reports provide additional context that policymakers and stakeholders will likely want to access, before the fifteenth meeting of the conference of the parties later this year.

healthy and functional ecosystems help reduce climate change vulnerability and disaster risk by:

reducing physical exposure to hazards by serving as protective barriers or buffers and so mitigating hazard impacts, including in wetlands, forests and coastal ecosystems; and
	reducing socioeconomic vulnerability to hazard impacts: in addition to protective and hazard regulatory functions of ecosystems, they also sustain human livelihoods and provide essential goods such as food, fibre, medicines and construction materials, which strengthen people<U+0092>s resilience to disasters.
examples of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction include restoring coastal vegetated areas such as mangroves to protect shorelines from storm surges; managing invasive alien species linked to land degradation and that threaten food security and water supplies; and managing ecosystems to complement, protect and extend longevity of investments in hard infrastructure.  

in many cases, of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction activities are the same as eba activities implemented to reduce disaster risk. for example, maintaining and improving the functionality of protection forests is also a key activity within the some countries<U+0092> climate protection programmes. because of the important role of forests in mitigating the risks posed by natural hazards, these programme aim to improve the stability and functionality of forest stand structures, foster adapted species mixtures, promote natural regeneration, prevent forest fires and/or control pests and diseases.

biodiversity underpins the provision of food, fibre and water; it mitigates and provides resilience to climate change; it supports human health, and provides jobs in agriculture, fisheries, forestry and many other sectors. without effective measures to conserve biodiversity and use its components in a sustainable manner, the 2030 agenda will not be achievable.

there are critical biodiversity dependencies for sdg 2 on zero hunger, including target 2.4 relating to maintaining ecosystems and improvement of land and soil quality, and target 2.5 on maintaining the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their wild species. similarly, for sdg 8 on decent work and economic growth, biodiversity and healthy ecosystems are reflected in target 8.4 on decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation and target 8.9 relating to sustainable tourism.

crucially, protecting nature is also a key solution to counteracting the effects of climate change. sound policies to protect biodiversity will vary between regions; and recognizing the historical stewardship of indigenous and traditional communities that have sustained biodiversity for generations is critical to sustaining success. their valuable knowledge, traditions and cultural practices are essential to maintaining ecosystem services and food security in the face of rapid climate change.

the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat all rely on functioning natural systems and the production of common goods, livelihoods and our health and wellbeing also rely on nature. recent events have forced people around the world to re-evaluate the vital importance of nature, its impact in our daily lives and the huge threats it faces. pandemics and other emerging zoonoses cause more than a trillion dollars in economic damages annually, with covid-19 already costing tens of trillions. 

it is clearer than ever that our future and the future of our planet are intrinsically linked; and both are under threat. the links between pandemic risk and biodiversity show the need for an inclusive, transdisciplinary and cross-sectoral one health approach, as identified in the fifth edition of the global biodiversity outlook 5. 

this earth hour, world wildlife fund (wwf) is asking everyone to speak up for nature and help spark millions of conversations to elevate nature loss to a global audience. we must stop the destruction of nature on which our health, happiness and prosperity depend.

on each international day of forests, countries are encouraged to undertake local, national and international efforts to organize activities involving forests and trees, such as tree planting campaigns.  the year 2021 is particularly special as it marks the start of the un decade on ecosystem restoration, a decade where forests, which harbour 80 per cent of the world<U+0092>s biodiversity will play a crucial role.  

forest biodiversity is interlinked to a web of other socio-economic factors, providing an array of goods and services that range from timber and non-timber forest resources to mitigating climate change and genetic resources. at the same time, forests provide livelihoods for people worldwide and play important economic, social, and cultural roles in the lives of many indigenous communities.
forests and forest biological diversity are innately linked to ecosystem and human well-being. as the the world is still reeling from the covid-19 pandemic, the sustainable use of biodiversity needs to be part of the blueprint for <U+0091>building back better<U+0092>. global recovery programs must have strong environmental safeguards in place and make full use of the opportunities in the forest sector to reset economies on a greener track. 

these solutions will need to be deployed at scale, including in post-pandemic recovery packages, policies and financial mechanisms.  this will give us a head start on the goals of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and stabilize or reverse trends of biodiversity loss over the next 10 years.  this will allow for the recovery of natural ecosystems in the following 20 years, with improvements by 2050 to achieve the un vision of <U+0093>living in harmony with nature<U+0094>.

the report is a joint effort by the united nations environment programme (unep) and the international livestock research institute (ilri). it identifies seven trends driving the increasing emergence of zoonotic diseases, including increased demand for animal protein; a rise in intense and unsustainable farming; the increased use and exploitation of wildlife; and the climate crisis. the report finds that africa in particular, which has experienced and responded to a number of zoonotic epidemics including most recently, to ebola outbreaks, could be a source of important solutions to quell future outbreaks.



the report identifies ten practical steps that governments can take to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks:

investing in interdisciplinary approaches, including one health;
	expanding scientific enquiry into zoonotic diseases;
	improving cost-benefit analyses of interventions to include full-cost accounting of societal impacts of disease;
	raising awareness of zoonotic diseases;
	strengthening monitoring and regulation practices associated with zoonotic diseases, including food systems;
	incentivizing sustainable land management practices and developing alternatives for food security and livelihoods that do not rely on the destruction of habitats and biodiversity;
	improving biosecurity and control, identifying key drivers of emerging diseases in animal husbandry and encouraging proven management and zoonotic disease control measures;

maintenance of this biodiversity is essential for the sustainable production of food and other agricultural products and the benefits these provide to humanity, including food security, nutrition and livelihoods. the different crop varieties and animal breeds used in agriculture around the world are based on the world<U+0092>s genetic diversity. in addition, biodiversity directly supports agriculture systems by helping to ensure soil fertility, pollination and pest control.

the convention on biological diversity<U+0092>s work on agriculture and biodiversity can contribute to the achievement of the targets for sustainable development goal 2 on zero hunger and aichi biodiversity targets 7 and 13. the secretariat works with many partners, including the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), biodiversity international, and the secretariat of the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, to build coordinated approaches for food security and sustainable agriculture.

in addition to  the tragic loss of life, the covid-19 pandemic will have lasting impacts on sustainable development. the asian development bank estimates that covid-19 will cost the global economy trillions of dollars. 

by comparison, the world bank estimated that prevention would require an average per capita expenditure of $1.69 annually to achieve an acceptable level of epidemic preparedness.  in addition to very high costs to economies, pandemics also have wide ranging long-term consequences to people<U+0092>s health and productivity, by diverting resources from non-emergency health care and other public goods and services. 

<U+0093>the outbreak will have profound and lasting economic and social consequences in every corner of the globe,<U+0094> says inger andersen, executive director of the un environment programme. <U+0093>in the aftermath of the crisis, when economic stimulus packages composed of infrastructure are designed, there is a real opportunity to meet that demand with green packages of renewable energy investments, smart buildings, green and public transport, etc.<U+0094> 

preventing zoonotic disease spread

the covid-19 global crisis has made clear that more robust, comprehensive and coordinated prevention strategies are needed. it is also critical that all countries have the capacity to detect, assess, and respond to public health events that may arise in future. key preventative measures include:

surveillance:   continuous monitoring of indicators of the rise of zoonotic diseases and information-sharing between human health, agriculture, and environment sectors is a key component to better understanding disease transmission dynamics.  
	
	investment:   spending on pandemic prevention is far less costly than response.  in 2003, the sars outbreak alone cost an estimated $52 billion. 
	
	
	collaboration:   multisectoral policy development and implementation are foundational pillars of prevention, early detection and response. <U+0091>one health<U+0092> is an integrated approach to the design of programmes, policies, legislation and research with joint participation from governments, in collaboration with diverse sectors and disciplines, including public health, veterinary medicine, epidemiology, ecology, and others. 
	
<U+0093>the one health approach, which recognizes the intrinsic connection between human health, animal health and the health and resilience of ecosystems, can help guide us towards an effective post-2020 global biodiversity framework and help achieve the sustainable development goals,<U+0094> cbd acting executive secretary elizabeth maruma mrema says.

 

building back better

in their efforts to stimulate post-covid-19 economic recovery, some governments have announced plans to roll back environmental standards or related measures. but experts question whether the potential short-term economic boost is worth the long-term costs to resilience. 

<U+0093>scientists warn that deforestation, industrial agriculture, illegal wildlife trade, climate change and other types of environmental degradation increase the risk of future pandemics, raising the probability of major human rights violations,<U+0094> says david boyd, the un special rapporteur on human rights and the environment.

the pandemic already is expected to result in an increase in the amounts of medical and hazardous waste generated. the addition of policy decisions that allow for increased or unmonitored pollution to water or the air has broad, negative ecological impacts.

<U+0093>it is my greatest hope that the fight against covid-19 will soon be won; and that, as we recover, we can pursue the opportunity to re-imagine and transform our relationship with nature while promoting community and global health,<U+0094> mrema says.

water means different things to different people because of its intrinsic, traditional, cultural and social values. to acknowledge the true value of water we must protect and conserve our healthy marine, coastal and freshwater ecosystems to ensure water for all.

water and sanitation remain critical to containing the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, highlighting the value of sustainably managing water resources and protecting the ecosystems that provide this precious resource. integrated water resource management approaches are needed to reinforce the value of water and rethink our relationship between water, people and health.

these approaches must also aim to involve more diverse stakeholder groups and transition to multi-value water governance, as women and girls are often disproportionately impacted by inadequate water and sanitation conditions.

the fifth global biodiversity outlook outlines several sustainable transitions geared towards reversing biodiversity loss and its impacts on ecosystems. the sustainable freshwater transition promotes an integrated approach to guarantee the flow of water for nature and people, by improving water quality, protecting critical habitats, controlling invasive species, and safeguarding connectivity between habitats. 

water is everything to us <U+0096> it is our origin and our future. from the vast oceans to the water vapour in our atmosphere, water unites all of nature and its processes. water is one of our planet<U+0092>s most valuable resources for its direct necessity for people and for the proper functioning of ecosystems.

 

the united nations world water development report 2021: valuing water

today the united nations world water development report 2021 on valuing water was launched. the report is the un-water flagship report on water issues, published by unesco and coordinated by the unesco world water assessment programme.

the report assesses the current status of and challenges to the valuation of water across differing sectors and perspectives and identifies ways in which valuation can be promoted as a tool to help achieve sustainability. 

valuation of water infrastructure involves various scales, from site-specific to system-wide, taking account of the type of project, as well as the hydrological, environmental and social conditions. this report provides a snapshot of approaches to considering multiple values, and reaching transparent and equitable decisions.

""how has the pandemic affected the biodiversity agenda?
one could say that i have been appointed at a bad time for biodiversity, considering that the whole world is just emerging from, or still in, lockdown because of the covid-19 pandemic. but at the same time, i see it as a major opportunity, as biodiversity is being discussed more than ever before. there is greater awareness of the impact that human activities can have on nature, and of the connection between human health and biodiversity.

our interference, through deforestation, agricultural expansion, livestock intensification and habitat fragmentation, has exposed wild animals and brought them into closer contact with people, which has resulted in the spillover of pathogens and zoonotic diseases, human-to-human transmission through trade and tourism, and the explosive pandemic we currently find ourselves in.

these are not new issues to the convention. but the pandemic has brought these issues to the fore, and has emphasized discussions about how to prevent future pandemics. i still consider 2020 to be a super year for biodiversity, as we spend it preparing, talking, creating awareness and showing the links. 2021 will be the year for the deal.

 

how will you ensure that you don<U+0092>t lose momentum by next year?
my number-one goal is to get more stakeholders engaged and speaking about the importance of biodiversity and nature, and learning about the impact of human activities on biodiversity loss, and on climate change, changes in land use, pollution and invasive species.

these stakeholders will help us by putting positive pressure on governments to agree on an ambitious and transformative, post-2020 global biodiversity framework, and can then help us in implementing the agreement. we don<U+0092>t want kunming just to be a meeting of environmental communities, but to involve youth, businesses, local communities, cities and municipalities.

these efforts are continuing in the virtual world. if anything, we have had more consultations and more time to prepare and engage during this period. i am seeing a lot of support and commitment, but for now these are only words. will they translate into tangible, measurable, smart actions that will make a difference? that keeps me up at night.""

"35","Traditional techniques provide useful models for biodiversity policies","https://www.cbd.int/traditional/","the international community has recognized the close and traditional dependence of many indigenous peoples and local communities on biological resources, notably in the preamble to the convention on biological diversity (cbd). there is also a broad recognition of the contribution that traditional knowledge can make to both the conservation and the sustainable use of biological diversity, two fundamental objectives of the cbd.

as a result of the convention<U+0092>s adoption and the work being conducted under its auspices, governments have already undertaken to facilitate the participation of indigenous peoples and local communities in developing policies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological resources, access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits, and the designation and management of protected areas.
many governments are now in the process of implementing article 8(j) of the convention through their national biodiversity action plans, strategies and programmes. several governments have adopted specific laws, policies and administrative arrangements for protecting traditional knowledge, emphasizing that the prior informed consent of knowledge holders must be attained before their knowledge can be used by others.

a growing respect for traditional knowledge has led modern science to adapt its procedures for assessing the impact of development projects on biodiversity. governments are also seeking to involve indigenous peoples and local communities more actively, and to apply their knowledge and technologies, in the conservation and sustainable use of forests, agricultural biodiversity, inland waters, coastal and marine ecosystems, rangelands and eco-tourism.

our societies are intimately linked with and depend on biodiversity. its loss and the degradation of its contributions to people jeopardize progress towards the sustainable development goals (sdgs) and human wellbeing. the covid-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of the relationship between people and nature. 
 
the summit highlighted the crisis facing humanity from the degradation of biodiversity and the urgent need to accelerate action on biodiversity for sustainable development. it provided an opportunity for heads of state and government and other leaders to raise ambition for the development of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the conference of parties to the convention on biological diversity, to be held in 2021. this framework, and its effective implementation, must put nature on a path to recovery by 2030 to meet the sdgs and realize the vision of <U+0093>living in harmony with nature<U+0094>.

the scope, modalities, format and organization of the summit have been set out in general assembly resolution 74/269, and by decision 74/562 on the high-level meetings during the 75th session of the assembly. 

the summit was held on 30 september, 2020 and member states, observer states and the european union submitted pre-recorded statements of their head of state / government, ministers or other head of delegation, which was played in the general assembly hall.

"47","UNEP Synthesis Report: Making Peace with Nature","https://www.unep.org/resources/making-peace-nature, https://www.cbd.int/gbo5","released ahead of the fifth un environment assembly, the report presents a strong case for why and how urgent action should be taken to protect and restore the planet and its climate in a holistic way. 

the report provides an 'earth diagnosis' of current and projected human-induced environmental change, by putting facts and interlinkages in perspective, including by using smart infographics.

tackling three planetary threats together

the report shows how a trio of environmental emergencies interact and have common causes, and thus can only be effectively addressed together:

economic growth has brought uneven gains in prosperity to a fast-growing global population, leaving 1.3 billion people poor, while tripling the extraction of natural resources to damaging levels and creating a planetary emergency.
	despite a temporary decline in emissions due to the pandemic, earth is heading for at least 3°c of global warming this century; more than 1 million of the estimated 8 million plant and animal species are at substantially increased risk of extinction; and diseases caused by pollution are currently killing some 9 million people prematurely every year. 
	environmental degradation is impeding progress towards ending poverty and hunger, reducing inequalities and promoting sustainable economic growth, work for all and peaceful and inclusive societies.
making peace with nature presents examples of what transformative change can look like, and how it can create prosperity, employment and greater equality. far-reaching change involves recasting how we value and invest in nature, integrating that value into policies and decisions at all levels, overhauling subsidies and other elements of economic and financial systems, and fostering innovation in sustainable technologies and business models. massive private investment in electric mobility and alternative fuels show how whole industries recognize the potential gains from shifting quickly. 

reinforcing the call for action, the report stresses the need for stakeholders at all levels of society to be involved in decision-making, and identifies dozens of key actions that governments, businesses, communities and individuals can and should undertake in order to bring about a sustainable world.

key comment

<U+0093>in showing how the health of people and nature are intertwined, the covid-19 crisis has underlined the need for a step-change in how we view and value nature. by reflecting that value in decision-making <U+0096> whether we are talking about economic policy or personal choices <U+0096> we can bring about a rapid and lasting shift toward sustainability for both people and the environment,<U+0094> -- inger andersen, executive director, unep

while the formal meetings of sbstta-24 and sbi-3 are delayed because of the ongoing pandemic, virtual informal sessions of these meeting are being convened on the following dates:

informal session in preparation for sbstta-24: 17-19 february and 24-26 february 2021 
	informal session in preparation for sbi-3: 8-12 march and 14 march 2021
all sessions will last three hours per day and will be held from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. est.

the difference between the informal and formal sessions is that there will be no negotiations or decisions taken during this online meeting.

the informal meeting will serve as an opportunity for parties and observers to explore the virtual format, and to exchange opinions on key agenda items on the road to developing a scientifically and technically sound post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

more than 1,832 participants have registered, representing 130 countries and many organizations.  although no decisions or formal outcomes or conference room papers will be prepared at the informal sessions, all members of the public are encouraged to take part by watching the sessions and engaging in discussion on social media.

with the support of the secretariat and the guidance of the chair of the subsidiary body on implementation and the bureau of the conference of the parties, this meeting will provide the necessary support for our formal discussions at the third meeting
of the subsidiary body, leading us on the pathway to the adoption of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

the need for effective multilateralism has never been greater or more urgent. as the global community faces one of the greatest health, economic, social, environmental and developmental challenges of our time, we must ask ourselves how we can prevent this from happening again. certainly, these challenges are multifaceted and thus cannot be tackled in isolation. cooperation across all domains and sectors of society will be critical in mobilising and scaling up action and prevention in order to reduce the risk of future pandemics. as the world <U+0091>recovers back better<U+0092>, recognising the intrinsic connection between human health and the health and resilience of nature must serve not just as a stark reminder of the negative human actions on nature, but also as the basis of a global integrated approach for one health, so that policies are coordinated and multiple sectors work together to achieve better public health outcomes.

the convention on biological diversity stemmed from a growing international recognition that biological diversity is a global asset of tremendous value to the present as well as to future generations. unfortunately, selfish human activities were, and still are, gravely endangering it. it is no longer undeniable that biodiversity is the foundation of human life and the part of nature that is alive. it covers all the relationships between living beings and the natural world including their environments, and therefore is not limited to being solely an inventory of species. we cannot survive without the biodiversity that feeds us, houses us, cures us and provides us with the air we breathe and the water we drink <U+0096> plus all that nature inherently nurtures and sustains for human well-being.

a blueprint for biodiversity

parties to the convention are currently developing the post-2020 global biodiversity framework with contributions from all stakeholders. it will be the overarching and universal blueprint framework on biodiversity <U+0096> not only for the convention and all biodiversity-related agreements, but also for the entire united nations system as well as the global community at large. the framework, which is expected to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the conference of the parties in kunming, china, will play a momentous role in building resilience in the face of growing environmental, health, food security and development challenges. it will galvanise the global community to seek collaborative, multistakeholder joint solutions across these sectors. without an ambitious framework that is embraced by all partners and stakeholders, the current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystems loss will continue to undermine progress towards global goals including the sustainable development goals and those under the paris agreement.

the united nations general assembly summit on biodiversity on 30 september 2020 was an important milestone on the road to cop 15. it highlighted the strong interlinkages among climate change, biodiversity loss and land degradation. it reminded the international community that nature-based solutions, building on the preservation and restoration of biological diversity and ecosystems, offer an important opportunity for shared progress during the decade of action for sustainable development. as stated by the secretary-general of the united nations, the world must take concerted action to safeguard our planet and ensure sustainable development that benefits the health, security and well-being of all peoples, particularly those in developing countries and among marginalised and vulnerable populations globally.

what is at stake

as we move to negotiate and adopt the framework next year, it remains urgent for the global community to increase its understanding of what is at stake, to foster action and the necessary transformation that secures the healthy future of this planet and all its peoples. this aligns extremely well with the themes of the g20 riyadh summit of empowering people, especially women and youth, and of safeguarding the planet by fostering collective efforts to protect our global commons. to achieve the level of transformation required to fulfil the needs of all peoples while protecting our planet, we need to work hand in hand with all sectors to reinforce the political importance of biodiversity at the highest levels. for this transformation to happen, the g20 plays the decisive role in moving the biodiversity agenda forwards without undermining its linkages with other sectors.

we will need transformative changes of our development models, as well as whole-of-government, whole-of-society integrated approaches on the basis of shared responsibility and global solidarity, in order to restore and protect nature, thereby ensuring the integrity and advancement of human well-being. greener and sustainable post<U+0096>covid-19 recovery approaches provide an opportune moment for such transformation. it is my hope that the deliberations and decisions taken at the riyadh summit will provide further decisive steps in advancing this important global and multilateral agenda.""

	we strengthen our resolve to conserve our marine and terrestrial environment in advance of the upcoming conference of the parties (cop15) to the convention on biological diversity (cbd). we launch the global coral reef r&d accelerator platform to conserve coral reefs and the global initiative on reducing land degradation and enhancing conservation of terrestrial habitats to prevent, halt, and reverse land degradation. building on existing initiatives, we share the ambition to achieve a 50 percent reduction of degraded land by 2040, on a voluntary basis. we reaffirm our commitment to reduce additional pollution by marine plastic litter, as articulated by the osaka blue ocean vision, and to end illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.
	we stress our continued resolve to ensure a stable and uninterrupted supply of energy to achieve economic growth as we respond to the challenges brought about by the pandemic. we recognize the importance of expediting universal access, relying on innovation across fuels and technology options, to affordable and reliable energy for all, in accordance with national circumstances, including ensuring access to clean cooking and electricity. in this regard, we recognize the importance of utilizing the widest variety of fuels and technology options, according to national context, and leading energy transitions to realize the ""3e+s"" (energy security, economic efficiency, and environment + safety). we acknowledge the importance of maintaining undisrupted flows of energy and exploring paths to enhanced energy security and markets stability, while promoting open, competitive, and free international energy markets. we endorse the g20 initiative on clean cooking and energy access and g20 energy security and markets stability cooperation. we welcome the measures and recommendations of the energy focus group (efg), as endorsed by the energy ministers party to the efg, to rebalance the energy markets and continue short and long-term investments. we reaffirm our joint commitment on medium term rationalization and phasing-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, while providing targeted support for the poorest.
	we endorse the circular carbon economy (cce) platform, with its 4rs framework (reduce, reuse, recycle and remove), recognizing the key importance and ambition of reducing emissions, taking into account system efficiency and national circumstances. the cce is a voluntary, holistic, integrated, inclusive, pragmatic, and complementary approach to promote economic growth while enhancing environmental stewardship through managing emissions in all sectors including, but not limited to, energy, industry, mobility, and food. we acknowledge, in this context, the various voluntary opportunities and their acceleration highlighted by the cce guide. we acknowledge the presidency reports of the climate stewardship working group that can be utilized as a toolbox in addressing sustainability including climate change in the context of national circumstances. we also acknowledge the importance of fostering synergies between adaptation and mitigation, including through nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches.
	in advance of the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) cop26 in glasgow and the uncbd cop15 in kunming, we reiterate our support for tackling pressing environmental challenges, such as climate change and biodiversity loss, as we promote economic growth, energy security and access for all, and environmental protection. signatories to the paris agreement who confirmed at osaka their determination to implement it, once again, reaffirm their commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. these signatories recall the request by cop21 to communicate or update their nationally determined contributions reflecting their highest possible ambition, in accordance with their obligations under the paris agreement, taking into account means of implementation; and emphasize the importance of providing and mobilizing a wide variety of financial resources, to assist developing countries in their adaptation and mitigation efforts, in accordance with the unfccc and the paris agreement, reaffirming the importance of international cooperation. in addition, these signatories reiterate the invitation to communicate by 2020 long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies. these signatories recall the commitment made by developed countries to a goal of mobilizing jointly usd 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. all g20 members also continue to support efforts and utilize all available approaches aimed at advancing environmental stewardship for future generations, and emphasize that further global efforts are needed to address these challenges, while maintaining healthy economies conducive to growth, decent jobs, and innovation.

"76","The <U+0093>blue economy<U+0094> is critical to food security and the fight against poverty","","the fisheries and aquaculture sector is a vital source of livelihoods, nutritious food and economic opportunities, and has a key role to play in meeting one of the world<U+0092>s greatest challenges: feeding a population set to rise to 9.6 billion people by 2050. fisheries and aquaculture play a significant role in eliminating hunger, promoting health and reducing poverty. never before have people consumed so much fish or depended so greatly on the sector for their well-being. fish is extremely nutritious <U+0096> a vital source of protein and essential nutrients, especially for the poor. but fisheries and aquaculture is a source not just of health but also of wealth. employment in the sector has grown faster than the world<U+0092>s population. small-scale fisheries (marine and inland) employ about 90% of those involved in fisheries. globally, the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated at $3 trillion per year or about 5% of global gdp.

fish continues to be one of the most-traded food commodities worldwide. it is especially important for developing countries, sometimes worth half the total value of their traded commodities. oceans, seas, coastal areas and the associated blue economy are critical to global and national development, food security and the fight against hunger and poverty. they are both engines for economic growth and sources of food and jobs. however, overfishing, pollution and unsustainable coastal development are contributing to irreversible damage to habitats, ecological functions and biodiversity. climate change and ocean acidification are compounding such impacts at a time when the rising global population requires more fish as food, and as coastal areas are becoming home to a growing percentage of the world<U+0092>s population.

<U+0093>acb 2020,<U+0094> said dr. jayakumar, <U+0093>is intended to provide a forum for exchanging perspectives on initiatives that address biodiversity issues in the region and chart transformative actions that will affect the needed change to conserve biodiversity and attain sustainable development in asean.<U+0094>

acb 2020<U+0092>s official logo and website were unveiled during the ceremony attended by acb executive director theresa mundita lim, and the ambassadors and representatives of the ams and megadiverse countries.

the conference will feature sessions that tackle the status of biodiversity in the asean region, progress made by asean member states in achieving the 2020 global targets, and the transformative actions to be taken to achieve the overarching goal of nations to live in harmony with nature by 2050.

jayakumar announced that malaysia will host the asean high-level ministerial meeting on biological diversity on 19 march 2020 and the asean plus megadiverse countries high-level ministerial meeting on 20 march 2020.

<U+0093>these meetings are aimed at bringing together the ministers and senior officials from the asean member states and the megadiverse countries and will provide a strategic platform to strengthen cooperation and exchange of ideas and experiences towards achieving the objectives of the convention on biological diversity,<U+0094> said dr. jayakumar.

for her part, lim said acb 2020 is taking place at an exciting time. <U+0093>2020 is a super year for the environment. as the countries<U+0092> strategic plans for biodiversity ends this year, we are taking stock of our progress and we are discussing our next steps, the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.<U+0094>

the primary objectives of the high-level meetings at acb 2020 include having a stronger voice and unified position for upcoming biodiversity treaty events, such as the 15th meeting of the conference of parties to the convention on biological diversity in kunming, china, where the post-2020 global biodiversity framework is expected to be finalized. 

one expected highlight at the acb 2020 is the launch of asean green initiative, a project of the asean secretariat to plant millions of trees across the region to strengthen efforts on biodiversity conservation and address issues of ecosystem degradation and climate change. 

the five-day event, to be held at the kuala lumpur convention centre, is organised by malaysia<U+0092>s ministry of water, land, and natural resources (kats), and the acb, with support from the united nations development programme, the european union through the biodiversity conservation and management of protected areas in asean (bcamp), the federal government of germany through kfw and giz, the government of norway through asean-norway cooperation, the cbd secretariat and swedbio.

yet every minute, we lose 40 football fields of rainforests, which threatens our biodiversity and imperils our planet<U+0092>s health. deforestation causes 15% of global carbon dioxide emissions that accelerate climate change<U+0097>more than from all cars in the u.s. and china combined. natural climate solutions like protecting and restoring forests, however, could reverse global emissions by a third.

world rainforest day celebrates this precious natural resource and encourages action to preserve it. your efforts, together with the actions of others, will have a positive impact on rainforests and the climate worldwide.

several events will take place throughout the day. take a look at the live event schedule by visiting: https://worldrainforestday.org/schedule/

 

simple ways you can help save rainforests:

become informed about the latest threats facing rainforests, such as industrial deforestation, human-caused climate change, and a loss of protected forest areas.
	volunteer your time or donate to groups working to protect forests
	be mindful when purchasing products: avoid products such as unregulated palm oil, viscose or rayon, cocoa and beef products. look for forest-friendly brands!

we are in a state of planetary emergency of interconnected global challenges, including biodiversity loss, climate change, zoonotic disease exposure, land degradation, water scarcity, waste and pollution. these require urgent and united global actions. world leaders must take urgent and transformational actions to rebalance our relationship with the natural world. they must prioritize a just economic recovery focused on net positive outcomes for nature and climate, and support an ambitious and transformational post-2020 global biodiversity framework as a key tool to achieving the sustainable development goals.

to mark this commitment, a high-profile event, taking place ahead of the un summit on biodiversity, brings together world leaders, representing more than 20 countries from all regions, to send a strong, united signal to step up global ambition for biodiversity and to encourage others to commit to matching their collective ambition for nature, climate and people.

we reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism, based on unity, solidarity and trust among countries, peoples and generations, as the only way for the world to effectively respond to current and future global environmental crises. 

we are in a state of planetary emergency: the interdependent crises of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation and climate change - driven in large part by unsustainable production and consumption - require urgent and immediate global action. science clearly shows that biodiversity loss, land and ocean degradation, pollution, resource depletion and climate change are accelerating at an unprecedented rate. this acceleration is causing irreversible harm to our life support systems and aggravating poverty and inequalities as well as hunger and malnutrition. unless halted and reversed with immediate effect, it will cause significant damage to global economic, social and political resilience and stability and will render achieving the sustainable development goals impossible. 

biodiversity loss is both accelerated by climate change and at the same time exacerbates it, by debilitating nature<U+0092>s ability to sequester or store carbon and to adapt to climate change impacts. ecosystem degradation, human encroachment in ecosystems, loss of natural habitats and biodiversity and the illegal wildlife trade can also increase the risk of emergence and spread of infectious diseases. covid-19 shows that these diseases have dramatic impacts not only on loss of life and health but across all spheres of society. 

nature fundamentally underpins human health, wellbeing and prosperity. we need to appropriately value nature and the services it provides as we make decisions and recognize that the business case for biodiversity is compelling. the benefits of restoring natural resources outweigh the costs ten-fold, and the cost of inaction is even higher. 

despite ambitious global agreements and targets for the protection, sustainable use and restoration of biodiversity, and notwithstanding many local success stories, the global trends continue rapidly in the wrong direction. a transformative change is needed: we cannot simply carry on as before. 

this pledge is a recognition of this crisis and an expression of the need for a profound re-commitment from world leaders to take urgent action. against the backdrop of covid19, which has crippled the world<U+0092>s economies and pressured governments everywhere to begin the process of rebuilding and renewing, decisions made now will have ramifications for all of us and for generations to come.

as populations become larger, wealthier and more urban, there is an increasing demand for land to provide food, animal feed and fibre for clothing. meanwhile, the health and productivity of existing arable land is declining.

to have enough productive land to meet the demands of ten billion people by 2050, lifestyles need to change. desertification and drought day, running under the slogan <U+0093>food. feed. fibre.<U+0094> seeks to educate individuals on how to reduce their personal impact.

food, feed and fibre must also compete with expanding cities and the fuel industry. the end result is that land is being converted and degraded at unsustainable rates, which damages production, ecosystems and biodiversity.

with changes in consumer and corporate behaviour, and the adoption of more efficient planning and sustainable practices, there could be enough land to meet the demand. if every consumer were to buy products that do not degrade the land, suppliers would cut back the flow of these products and send a powerful signal to producers and policymakers.

that gdp has shortcomings as a measurement of human well-being is widely acknowledged by economists. many of these shortcomings are related to the lack of environmental indicators that account for associated benefits to human health, food and water security, and the economy.

healthy ecosystems provide services that have, in many cases, significant, measurable economic value. for instance, more than three-quarters of the leading global food crops rely on insect or animal pollination. between 5-8% of global crop production, with an annual market value between $235 and $577 billion, is directly attributable to natural pollination. however, pollinators are under threat, and this can be expected to lead to significant economic losses.

putting a spotlight on the need for women<U+0092>s leadership at all levels of decision-making and action on biodiversity emphasizes its importance for achieving transformational change. the ambition driving the development of the post-2020 agenda for biodiversity stems from the recognition of the dire state of the natural world and the little time remaining to change course.

effective leadership is a requirement for transformational change, and as such, so is the equal engagement of those who have long been excluded from these fora, particularly women, as well as other marginalized groups.

women<U+0092>s leadership and their full and effective engagement in the development and implementation of the framework is critical for the successful achievement of the 2050 vision of living in harmony with nature. those shouldering the greater share of the costs arising from biodiversity loss must have equal opportunity to lead decision-making processes related to biodiversity at all levels, and must be supported to have the capacity to do so effectively.

"125","Biodiversity provides cost-effective natural infrastructure","https://www.cbd.int/development/doc/biodiversity-2030-agenda-technical-note-en.pdf","the global urban population is expected to reach 5 billion by 2030, and over 60% of the land projected to become urban by 2030 has yet to be developed.

ecosystems and biodiversity underpin the day-to-day functioning of cities and human settlements by delivering the basic services and conditions that enable, support and protect human production, consumption and habitation. healthy ecosystems can provide protection and resilience from extreme weather events and disasters.

urban planning that integrates the consideration of biodiversity can not only benefit biodiversity but can also contribute to more sustainable human settlements. vegetation in cities can reduce the run-off of pollution into water bodies. coral reefs and mangrove forests protect coasts against flooding that are expected to increase with climate change. the strategic placement of trees in urban areas can cool the air between 2°c and 8°c. and, trees properly placed around buildings can reduce air conditioning needs by 30% and save energy used for heating by 20% to 50%.

many of the world<U+0092>s natural heritage sites are biologically diverse, and thus protecting biodiversity supports the preservation of such important areas.

nature-based solutions to the challenges of urban well-being, such as ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation (eba) and disaster risk reduction (eco-drr), enable safe human settlements.

the convention on biological diversity acknowledges the clear link between fisheries and biodiversity.  the parties enshrined the need for a strong focus on this link through the adoption of aichi biodiversity target 6 on sustainable fisheries, as part of the 20 aichi biodiversity targets.  aichi biodiversity target 6 addresses various elements of sustainable fishing, including fishing of target stocks, as well as minimizing and eliminating impacts on other species and ecosystems. there are, however, numerous challenges and capacity gaps in assessing progress towards these different elements.

the newly published cbd technical series no. 87 assessing progress towards aichi biodiversity target 6 on sustainable marine fisheries report, drafted by serge garcia and jake rice of the fisheries expert group of the iucn commission on ecosystem management, provides an expert analysis of the needs and challenges associated with the reporting and assessment of the different elements of target 6. this analysis also provides a valuable source of knowledge and lessons in setting future goals and targets, with associated monitoring and reporting frameworks, related to fisheries and biodiversity.

target 6 is not likely to be met by the end of 2020. still, it has led to achievements such as:

increased awareness of the link between fisheries and biodiversity.
	increased dialogue and collaboration between the fisheries and biodiversity communities.
	valuable insights in the development of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.
in addition, progress has been made on the development and implementation of measures aimed at achieving the mutually reinforcing goals of sustainable fisheries and biodiversity conservation. 

<U+0093>the substantial progress made towards target 6 underscores the crucial lesson that efforts to mainstream biodiversity into fisheries management, and fisheries into biodiversity conservation, are fully compatible-giving a solid foundation for working together towards our shared goals,<U+0094> said the report<U+0092>s co-author jake rice.

although target 6 will not be achieved, it<U+0092>s critical to learn lessons from progress made thus far, as the global community sets future goals and targets for biodiversity.

an urgent virtual workshop about the links between degradation of nature and increasing pandemic risks was convened by the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ipbes). the workshop resulted in the development of a major new report on biodiversity and pandemics which suggests that addressing disruptive human activities and unsustainable consumption and increasing biodiversity conservation are some of the changes needed to proactively deal with infectious diseases. the experts agree that:

unsustainable exploitation of the environment has led to almost all pandemics, and
	escaping the era of pandemics is possible, but that this will require a seismic shift in approach from reaction to prevention.
covid-19 is said to be the sixth global health pandemic since the great influenza pandemic of 1918.  although it has its origins in microbes carried by animals, like all pandemics its emergence has been entirely driven by human activities. it is estimated that another 1.7 million currently <U+0091>undiscovered<U+0092> viruses exist in mammals and birds <U+0096> of which up to 850,000 could have the ability to infect people.

the report says that relying on responses to diseases after their emergence, such as public health measures and technological solutions, in particular the rapid design and distribution of new vaccines and therapeutics, is a <U+0093>slow and uncertain path<U+0094>, underscoring both the widespread human suffering and the tens of billions of dollars in annual economic damage to the global economy of reacting to pandemics.

<U+0093>it is very clear that we must do better to prevent the emergence of infectious diseases rather than reacting to them once they are already here. reducing present and future pandemic risks can only be effective, and transformative, if we address the common drivers of biodiversity loss and ill health<U+0094> said elizabeth maruma mrema, executive secretary, convention on biological diversity.

conclusions reached in the report support the conclusions and recommendations put forth in the recently released fifth edition of the global biodiversity outlook (gbo-5). the gbo-5 outlines eight major transitions needed to slow, then halt nature<U+0092>s accelerating decline.

the ipbes report supports the lessons learned over the last decade of implementing the strategic plan for biodiversity 2011-2020 and provides directions for the way forward in developing the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, to be agreed in 2021.

ecosystems such as forests, rangelands, croplands, peatlands and wetlands represent globally significant carbon stores. their conservation, restoration and sustainable use is included as a part of many intended nationally determined contributions, and is therefore a critical element for the fulfilment of the paris agreement under the united nations framework convention for climate change, a global commitment toward the mitigation of dangerous changes to the earth<U+0092>s atmospheric temperature and climate system.

biodiversity and healthy ecosystems are also an important resource for increasing resilience and reducing the risks and damages associated with negative impacts of climate change. they can serve as natural buffers against extreme climate and weather events such as changing patterns of rainfalls, droughts, storms and other disasters. diversified and integrated production systems offer more options for adapting to a changing climate. ecosystem based production systems reduce the reliance on synthetic inputs and the associated emissions of greenhouse gases.

breeding drought, salt and disease resistant plant varieties, livestock breeds and fish will become important to ensure food security in the advance of climate change.

forests, forests species and the livelihoods that depend on them currently find themselves at the crossroads of the multiple planetary crises we currently face, from climate change, to biodiversity loss and the health, social and economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic.

sustainable wildlife management is the sound management of wildlife species to sustain their populations and habitat over time, considering the socioeconomic needs of human populations.  between 200 and 350 million people live within or adjacent to forested areas around the world, relying on the various ecosystem services provided by forest and forest species for their livelihoods and to cover their most basic needs, including food, shelter, energy and medicines. 

to fully ensure a sustainable future for forests and livelihoods, indigenous peoples and local communities (iplcs) need to be engaged.  as noted in the second edition of the local biodiversity outlooks (lbo-2), the relation between iplcs and wildlife is tied to their traditional knowledge and customary sustainable use of biodiversity. 

as parties to the convention on biological diversity discuss the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, to be agreed later this year in kunming, china, we have an important opportunity before us to highlight <U+0093>sustainable wildlife management<U+0094> as an essential tool to conserve biodiversity and for maintaining and enhancing forest ecosystem services. 
 

celebrations

on march 3 2021, world wildlife day will celebrate forest-based livelihoods and seek to promote forest and forest wildlife management models and practices that accommodate both human well-being and the long-term conservation of forests, forest-dwelling species of wild fauna and flora and the ecosystems they sustain, and promote the value of traditional practices and knowledge that contribute to establishing a more sustainable relationship with these crucial natural systems.

virtual event

this year will feature the first-ever virtual celebration of the united nations<U+0092> world wildlife day! un member states, un system organizations and multilateral environmental agreements, civil society, and the private sector will be brought together for a series of discussions along the theme of ""forests and livelihoods: sustaining people and planet"".

we will highlight the experiences and knowledge of iplcs whose livelihoods rely on forests and wildlife, and who have a long history of managing and sustainably using forest ecosystems.

the theme of this year<U+0092>s world wildlife day, ""forests and livelihoods: sustaining people and planet"", foregrounds the importance of iplcs, as well as the challenges they face.  on this world wildlife day, international indigenous forum on biodiversity, the indigenous women<U+0092>s biodiversity network, the centres of distinction on indigenous and local knowledge, forest peoples programme and the secretariat of the convention on biological diversity are marking the occasion by publishing the digital version of local biodiversity outlooks 2 (lbo-2) in english, spanish and french.

lbo-2 is a landmark piece of collaborative research and analysis that features contributions from over 50 indigenous and local authors and communities. the report highlights the critical roles played by iplcs in maintaining and enhancing biological and cultural diversity and outlines indigenous and local perspectives on the transformational changes needed in order to realise the vision of a world living in harmony with nature.

nature-based solutions use or mimic natural processes to enhance water availability and reduce risks associated with water-related disasters and climate change and can help us move beyond the business as-usual approaches to tackle many of the planet<U+0092>s water challenges, while simultaneously delivering additional benefits vital to all aspects of sustainable development.

the benefits of nature-based solutions include increasing the resilience of countries to climate risks, including droughts, floods and erosions, playing a role in biodiversity and soil protection, ecological rehabilitation and meeting other development challenges such as access to safe drinking water, food security and human health, land degradation neutrality, sustainable cities as well as tourism.

natural ecosystems and biodiversity are fundamental to sustainability. for example, wetlands function as natural sponges that trap and slowly release surface water, rain, snowmelt, ground water and flood waters, thus helping to slow down the movement of water to surrounding areas. and while nature-based solutions are not a panacea for all of our issues, it is clear that we need to make better use of the solutions already found in nature.

this year the theme of world migratory bird day is <U+0093>birds connect our world<U+0094> and was chosen to highlight the importance of conserving and restoring the ecological connectivity and integrity of ecosystems that support the natural cycles that are essential for the survival and well-being of migratory birds. the theme also underlines the fact that migratory birds are part of our shared natural heritage and they depend on a network of sites along their migration routes for breeding, feeding, resting and overwintering.



last year, over 870 events were registered, including many gatherings of school groups and other public events which took place in city parks, wetlands and other places around the world often frequented by migratory birds. in comparison to past years, the global celebration of our avian friends and their fascinating annual migrations will look very different this year because of the unprecedented global health crisis the world is facing from covid-19. 

there are many ways for people to voice their support for bird conservation, and to celebrate and share their appreciation for migratory birds in countries, cities, towns and villages around the world. while public gatherings (even in small groups) will be impossible in most localities, there are numerous alternatives that people could consider:

hone your community birdwatching skills from your window, garden, balcony or, if you are able to spend time outside in public parks, the forest nearby or any other open spaces.
	use your social media channels to share your appreciation of migratory birds and the need for their conservation with the world! use the hashtags: #worldmigratorybirdday #wmbd2020 #birdsconnectourworld #birdsconnectus
	create a book club or run a virtual reading session for children with stories where the main characters are our beloved birds;
	host craft lessons (origami, painting - get creative!) that allow people to learn about birds;
	provide good habitat for your local birds by planting bird-friendly trees or shrubs, install nest boxes and protect them from possible predators such as house pets.

"171","World Oceans Day <U+0096> 8 June 2020","https://www.cbd.int/marine/, https://worldoceansday.org/","the ocean is hardly a static entity. it is changing all the time. as currents shift and move, coastal areas are eroded and marine species are forced to travel enormous distances, like never before. these challenges are on top of extensive changes to the ocean that climate change is bringing about. 

likewise, our relationship with the ocean has changed over time. rising global populations and increased demands for services and materials from the ocean has rapidly and steadily increased the pressure we are placing on this blue planet, with negative impacts for nature and those very services and materials that we as human beings need.

if we hope for the ocean to continue to support our well-being, then we too much change. hence, the timeliness and importance of the theme of this year<U+0092>s world oceans day, <U+0093>innovation for a sustainable ocean<U+0094>.

innovations are more likely to emerge when there is an enabling environment and incentives to bring them forth. under the convention on biological diversity, parties are negotiating the post-2020 global biodiversity, to be adopted at the forthcoming 15th meeting of the conference of the parties (cop 15). this framework will contain a new set of global goals and targets for biodiversity and will also aim to strengthen the enabling conditions for effective implementation. this framework will also aim to catalyze and support innovation among a wide range of stakeholders and sectors in order to accelerate progress towards reversing global trends in biodiversity loss.



 

we are seeing glimmers of hope in innovation all around. for example, upcycling of plastic waste from the ocean is giving new life to yesterday<U+0092>s waste, while technologies like waste drones are working to rid the ocean of debris. researchers are also developing fully autonomous solar powered research vessels to monitor marine mammals and other trends in the ocean.

however, not all innovation comes from modern cutting-edge technologies. local-scale and low-cost innovations, including from indigenous peoples and local communities, provide a wealth of possibilities. for example, local communities in central america are reducing waste flowing from rivers into the sea by stringing together mesh with plastic bottles, called <U+0091>biofences<U+0092>, which has reduced trash entering the sea by 60% in these areas.

we must be proactive and seek out innovative approaches to conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity, constantly questioning our long-held beliefs and practices. only then can we truly realize the transformative change needed to achieve a sustainable future for the ocean.

every year people around the world take action and organize public events such as bird festivals, education programmes, exhibitions and bird-watching excursions to celebrate. 

the theme, <U+0093>birds connect our world"", highlights the importance of conserving and restoring the ecological connectivity and integrity of ecosystems that support the natural movements of migratory birds and that are essential for their survival and well-being.

 

what can be done to prevent the problem?

migratory birds need a network of intact habitats along their entire migration routes to survive. increased global action through multilateral environment treaties, such as the convention on migratory species and the african-eurasian waterbird agreement, are essential to protect migratory birds on their international journeys. creating protected trans-boundary habitat corridors would be of great benefit to migratory birds and other migratory wildlife, specifically at the landscape scale.

in addition, networks of critical sites key to migration need to be safeguarded and managed properly. supporting important bird and biodiversity areas (ibas), as described by birdlife international, provides migratory birds with the necessary feeding, breeding, nesting and sheltering grounds that are needed during their long flights.
 

virtual events and a wave of online interactions are expected to take place in countries around the world in celebration of  world migratory bird day, with educational programmes being offered online by many organizations including schools, parks, zoos, forests, wildlife refuges, wetlands centres, museums and libraries.

forests have been on the international political agenda since the 1992 united nations conference on environment and development (unced), held in rio de janeiro, brazil. as a result of intensive negotiations, governments agreed to the non-legally binding authoritative statement of principles for a global consensus on the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests, also known as the <U+0093>forest principles.""

since this meeting, considerable progress has been made regarding forest biodiversity, with several international meetings being held and numerous processes being created. for example, the ministerial conference on the protection of forests in europe (mcpfe) is a political initiative involving 40 european countries as well as the european community. the mcpfe promotes the protection and sustainable management of forests in europe.

climate change has resulted in considerable attention being devoted to forests. as forests act both as a carbon sink and are likely to be greatly affected by climate change, they have become a growing issue of consideration for many governments and organizations. 

the convention on biological diversity addresses forests directly through the expanded programme of work on forest biodiversity (annex to cop 6 decision vi/22), adopted in 2002 by the conference of the parties at its sixth meeting. the forest work programme constitutes a broad set of goals, objectives and activities aimed at the conservation of forest biodiversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable use of the benefits arising from the utilization of forest genetic resources. the programme of work on forest biodiversity consists of three elements:

"176","Agriculture must be part of the solution, not the problem","","agriculture and biodiversity have been inextricably linked for as long as we humans have been producing our own food. as the source of all variety in our crops and livestock, biodiversity is the very foundation of agriculture. it is also a powerful force in our continued ability to produce enough food to feed a growing population, supporting farming through pollination, natural pest control, and soil health. in turn, agriculture supports all of humanity, producing an average of 23.7 million tons of food per day and providing livelihoods for 2.5 billion people. 

but right now, we have a problem: agriculture poses an unprecedented threat to biodiversity worldwide. intensified food production is damaging our environment through conversion of natural habitats to monocultures, soil degradation, unsustainable consumption of water, and unsustainable use of pesticides and fertilizers. although the value of agricultural crop production has almost tripled since 1970, indicators of nature<U+0092>s regulating contributions <U+0097> such as loss of pollinator and soil biodiversity <U+0097> have declined. these issues extend beyond agricultural areas, affecting forests, inland waters and coastal ecosystems. 

fortunately, agriculture is not only one of the problems we face <U+0097> it can also be part of the solution. sustainable agriculture can contribute to conservation of biodiversity while reaping the benefits. as we work to achieve our vision of living in harmony with nature, we must improve our agricultural systems to work with biodiversity, not against it. the good news is that many groups are already working to make this imperative a reality.

the resilient food systems programme is part of the critical push to make agriculture more sustainable. a five-year initiative in partnership with the un environment programme, the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao), and the united nations development programme (among others), this program is enhancing long-term sustainability and resilience for food security in sub-saharan africa with activities in 12 countries. to tackle these issues, they are focused on engaging and bringing together stakeholders from both agricultural and environmental sectors, promoting proven actions, and tracking the results to inform decision making. through an engage, act, and track framework, the program aims to increase genetic diversity of crops, reduce land degradation, recover natural vegetation, and increase the capacity of soils to sequester carbon.

another step in the sustainable agriculture movement is the global symposium on soil biodiversity, taking place next year. from bacteria to fungi to earthworms, the life in our soils is crucial to plant health (and therefore, to our health). the fao is hosting this major meeting from 10-12 march in rome.

the roles and responsibilities of men and women in the management of biodiversity, and the ability to participate in decision-making, vary between and within countries and cultures. however, in most circumstances there are gender-based differences and inequalities, which tend to favor males. stark gender differences are evident in economic opportunities and access to and control over land, biodiversity resources and other productive assets, in decision-making power, as well as in vulnerability to biodiversity loss, climate change and natural disasters.

to inform efficient policies regarding biodiversity conservation, sustainable use and the sharing of its benefits, we need to understand and expose gender-differentiated biodiversity practices, gendered knowledge acquisition and usage, as well as gender inequalities in control over resources. we need to consider the influences of gender differences and inequalities on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and the ways in which these differences and inequalities influence how women and men are affected by biodiversity policies, planning and programming.

beekeeping can also form the basis for gaining and transmitting knowledge about ecological processes.  furthermore, understanding of flowers and pollinators is part of the knowledge base for local communities around the globe. products produced by stingless bees, such as honey, wax, pollen and the bees themselves, are used by many indigenous peoples for different purposes, which include nourishment, traditional medicine, activities related to their spiritual and contemplative life and hand-crafting.

the government of costa rica worked with biofin to find solutions to the challenge of better managing liabilities acquired due to land acquisition programmes for protected areas. after detailed financial analysis and high-level consultations, and backed by a securitization agreement over tourism fees collected by the costa rica park system, a green bond will be issued to refund the land acquisition programme. income-generating assets of the securitization will be sources by an enhanced protected area fee system.
	finland: a 2019 government decision to invest substantially in halting domestic biodiversity loss will see public funding for nature conservation increased by 100m eur annually.
	france: in the area of financial market regulation/disclosure, a 2015 law on the energy transition for green growth requires institutional investors to disclose information related to esg and financial risks, which was a precursor to the international level task-force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd). further, in november 2019, france adopted a new regulation that will require financial market participants to disclose how they take into consideration biodiversity-related risks in their sustainability/esg assessments. work is also ongoing  to assess the impact of the private sector on biodiversity. as an illustration, cdc biodiversité developed the global biodiversity score (gbs). this corporate biodiversity footprint assessment tool focuses on the biodiversity impacts of economic activities across their value chain, in a robust and synthetic way.
	germany has provided more than 500m eur per year for conservation of forests and other ecosystems worldwide: this has more than quadrupled since 2007.  there has been a focus on development of sustainable finance mechanisms for pas, such as low-interest loans and the opening up of new funding sources from the private sector. effort has also been devoted to mainstreaming of biodiversity into agriculture, water and sustainable economic  development projects and programmes.
	japan introduced its made development cooperation charter in november 2015, and biodiversity conservation and others are written in <U+0093>building a sustainable and resilient international community through efforts to address global challenges<U+0094>, which is one of priority issues. based on this charter, japan has been supporting conservation projects of biodiversity and ecosystems in various locations in the world.
	in mexico, svx mexico, an impact investment advisory firm, together with biofin and the mexican fund for the conservation of nature, established the regenerative investment consortium to facilitate investment flows and build capacity in conservation organizations and investees. the investment portfolio will feature companies operating sustainably in the fisheries, agriculture, forestry, tourism, water, ranching, landscape management and green infrastructure sectors.
	in the seychelles, there is a strong business case for tourism operators to invest in conservation given their dependency on the preservation of pristine environments for attracting tourists. work is ongoing, supported by undp biofin, to create an enabling fiscal framework for the private sector to invest more and better in biodiversity, including through the introduction of tax deductions for expenditures incurred to obtain certifications, wages of biodiversity employees and other expenditure related to biodiversity conservation.  a debt-for-nature swap has been brokered by the nature conservancy, whereby through the of acquisition of $20m of sovereign debt, $5m of philanthropic funding is able to generate $432k per year for marine conservation and funding of an endowment.
	in sri lanka, within the mandate of the central bank road map, biofin is working with partners to design a business case for green financing products. this work is expected to produce an increase in the size and number of business loans connected to the sustainable use of biodiversity and natural resources to small and medium enterprises (smes). initial steps will involve increasing awareness of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use in the financial and production sectors.
	south africa<U+0092>s stewardship programmes are contributing significantly to national conservation targets. biodiversity stewardship is an approach to securing land in biodiversity priority areas. agreements are entered into between conservation authorities and private and communal landowners, often with the support of conservation ngos. landowners maintain ownership of their land, receive guidance and management assistance, and are supported to diversify their income with compatible sustainable livelihoods, all the while protecting biodiversity. this creates substantial cost-savings for the south africa government as it seeks to reach protected area targets. tax benefits have been developed to support landowners, acknowledging that the long-term commitment of land to protected area status and helping to offset the costs of managing the land.
	united kingdom funding for international biodiversity conservation increased from a baseline of £77.4m per annum between 2006 and 2010 to over £180m in 2015. the united kingdom is investing £5.8bn to support international climate finance between 2016 and 2021, which is helping to halt deforestation and help communities to protect and restore forests. the united kingdom has also announced a range of new funds for international biodiversity, notably a £220 million international biodiversity fund which includes £100 million for a new biodiversity landscapes fund targeted on global biodiversity hotspots. in spring 2019 the united kingdom treasury commissioned an independent review into the economics of biodiversity, to be led by professor sir partha dasgupta, emeritus professor of economics at the university of cambridge. the review is global in scope and aims to assess the economic value of biodiversity; to assess the economic costs and risks of biodiversity loss; and to identify actions that will simultaneously enhance biodiversity and deliver economic prosperity.

the living planet index (lpi), provided by the zoological society of london (zsl), shows that factors believed to increase the planet<U+0092>s vulnerability to pandemics - including land-use change and the use and trade of wildlife - were also some of the drivers behind the 68 per cent average decline in global vertebrate species populations between 1970 and 2016.

<U+0093>the living planet report 2020 underlines how humanity<U+0092>s increasing destruction of nature is having catastrophic impacts not only on wildlife populations but also on human health and all aspects of our lives,<U+0094> said marco lambertini, director general, wwf international.

the living planet report 2020 presents a comprehensive overview of the state of our natural world through the living planet index, which tracks trends in global wildlife abundance, and contributions from more than 125 experts from around the world. it shows that the main cause of the dramatic decline in species populations on land observed in the lpi is habitat loss and degradation, including deforestation, driven by how we as humanity produce food.

the lpi, which tracked almost 21,000 populations of more than 4,000 vertebrate species between 1970 and 2016, also shows that wildlife populations found in freshwater habitats have suffered a decline of 84 per cent - the starkest average population decline in any biome, equivalent to 4 per cent per year since 1970.

the living planet report 2020 launches less than a week before the 75th session of the united nations general assembly, when leaders are expected to review the progress made on the sustainable development goals, the paris agreement and the convention on biological diversity (cbd). the unga 2020 will bring together world leaders, businesses and civil society to develop the post-2020 framework for action for global biodiversity and thus marks a milestone moment to set the groundwork for an urgently needed new deal for nature and people.

lambertini said: <U+0093>with leaders gathering virtually for the un general assembly in a few days<U+0092> time, this research can help us secure a new deal for nature and people which will be key to the long-term survival of wildlife, plant and insect populations and the whole of nature, including humankind. a new deal has never been needed more.<U+0094>

world food day 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of fao in an exceptional moment as countries around the world deal with the widespread effects of the global covid-19 pandemic. it<U+0092>s a time to look into the future we need to build together.

food systems occupy nearly 40% of the ice-free surface of the earth and thus represent important levers in the fight to protect biodiversity. recognizing the role of biodiversity in underpinning the productivity and resilience of agricultural and other ecosystems is a critical first step towards transforming the way we produce food while guaranteeing food security. the recently released fifth edition of the global biodiversity outlook outlines two important pathways to address these issues and move from business as usual towards transformative change.

while agriculture contributes significantly to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, it is also a major driver of biodiversity loss. the earth<U+0092>s biodiversity is being lost at an alarming rate, putting in jeopardy the sustainability of agriculture and ecosystem services and their ability to adapt to changing conditions, threatening food and livelihoods security.

the major challenge for agriculture is to ensure food security, adequate nutrition and stable livelihoods for all, now and in the future, by increasing food production while adopting sustainable and efficient agriculture, sustainable consumption of resources, and landscape-level planning to ensure the preservation of biodiversity.
world food day is calling for global solidarity to help all populations, and especially the most vulnerable, to recover from the crisis, and to make food systems more resilient and robust so they can withstand increasing volatility and climate shocks, deliver affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all, and decent livelihoods for food system workers. this will require better social protection, innovation and digitalization, and sustainable agricultural practices that preserve the earth<U+0092>s natural resources, our health, and the climate. but we all have a role to play, from increasing the overall demand for nutritious food by choosing healthy, to not letting sustainable habits fall by the wayside, and joining the global solidarity effort, despite these uncertain times.

forests cover around 30% of earth<U+0092>s land area, containing 80% of terrestrial biomass and providing habitat for over half of the world<U+0092>s known terrestrial plant and animal species. although the net annual rate of forest loss has slowed over the past decades, it is still a matter of concern because the loss is occurring in areas with particularly high ecological value. while there is a marked increase in protected areas over the past century, many key biodiversity areas are not adequately covered by protected area status. globally there are more than a billion hectares of deforested and degraded forest land that could be restored, a vast area with the potential to enrich biodiversity and improve ecosystem functions.

ecosystem approaches to farming and grazing that foster biodiversity in soil microorganisms and soil macro and microfauna promote and maintain the soil<U+0092>s physical and ecological health, thus preventing its erosion, while preserving and rebuilding soil fertility.

"201","How can Tourism work for Biodiversity?","https://www.cbd.int/tourism/","the earth<U+0092>s beautiful landscapes, fascinating species and diverse climates have captivated humanity for centuries. this natural allure has drawn individuals away from the comfort of their own homes to travel to distant lands; as a consequence, the tourism sector has strong economic, environmental and sociocultural links to biodiversity. 

while the sector can generate much revenue for protected areas, empower indigenous peoples and local communities culturally and financially, it can also significantly impact the natural environment if activities are not carried out with care.  for instance, co2 emissions from travel, strain on freshwater resources caused by tourist facilities and change in land use as a result of tourist-related developments are all major concerns. 

parties to the convention on biological diversity (cbd) have worked to enhance the financing of protected area networks through capturing revenues from visitation (concessions and partnerships), to support the sustainable development of special places called <U+0093>tourism and conservation hotspots<U+0094>, and to help indigenous peoples and local communities who are stewards of natural areas to complement their livelihood through ecotourism and community-based tourism. tourism carried out in this manner can help in the implementation of all 17 sustainable development goals, specifically contributing to sustainable economic growth, sustainable consumption and production, and the sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources. 

the cbd secretariat has contributed to sustainable tourism by developing, promoting and disseminating guidelines and manuals so that tourism activities are conducted while ensuring that measures are taken to protect biodiversity. it also works with the un world tourism organization, the private sector and ngos to encourage commitments and announcements towards the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

the work of the convention on biological diversity has been greatly enriched by youth. from their involvement in global decision-making to community actions, youth have become full partners in the fight against biodiversity loss. they are partners with vivid minds and unique perspectives, who can help define strategic priorities and implement creative solutions.

youth can take action towards innovation and transformative change. they have the capacity to use and develop new technologies for the benefit of nature as well as to engage with marginalized groups in our societies.

under the convention on biological diversity, youth can be invited by governments to join their delegations in official meetings; they participate in technical meetings; they receive in-kind or financial support to implement projects; and they get recognition for their work.

providing support to youth is not only an investment towards a world where we live in harmony with nature, but also in our institutions, better governance, sustainable development, gender and social equity.

here are four key moments for nature at hlpf.
 

1.    building back better after covid-19 

with covid-19 gripping the world<U+0092>s attention, many hlpf discussions focused on the recovery and how to reduce the risk of future pandemics. the un economic and social council held a discussion on how to build back better and protect people and planet, with a focus on action in areas that will have the greatest impact on the sdgs.

along with ministers and diplomats from colombia, suriname and sweden, the executive secretary discussed engaging public and private sector partners to halt nature degradation, reverse biodiversity loss and build community resilience.  panellists highlighted emerging opportunities and innovative nature-based solutions to help eradicate poverty, ensure food security, promote gender equality and secure livelihoods for all.

""conserving and sustainably using biodiversity must be at the core of our covid-19 recovery and future sustainable development pathways.""- elizabeth maruma mrema, cbd executive secretary

2.    the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and the sdgs

attended by government ministers, heads of international organizations and civil society groups, this cbd secretariat side event underscored the need for urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development. 

the co-chairs of the open-ended working group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, basile van havre and francis ogwal, briefed participants on the progress made towards the development of the framework. speakers shared new thinking on biodiversity in the context of sustainable development and discussed how the framework can contribute to a more resilient post-covid world.

the role of law and equity to manage nature contributes to an inclusive society based on justice and democratic decision-making.  recognizing rights to sustainable management of natural resources, enhancing values of biodiversity and related knowledge, and building an environment for equitable benefit-sharing has the potential to improve socioeconomic and political inequality among social groups.

global biodiversity outlook (gbo) is the flagship publication of the convention on biological diversity (cbd). gbo-5 provides global summary of progress towards the aichi biodiversity targets and sets the scene for the development of the post 2020-global biodiversity framework. it is based on a range of indicators, research studies and assessments (in particular the ipbes global assessment on biodiversity and ecosystem services), as well as the national reports provided by countries on their implementation of the cbd. this outlook draws on the lessons learned during the first two decades of this century to identify the transitions needed if we are to realize the vision agreed by world governments for 2050, <U+0091>living in harmony with nature<U+0092>.

two days of dialogue and debate will compel participants to get ready for a strong call to global action. but what action is most urgently needed? so many of us are pleading for transformative change <U+0096> but what does this require? experts will discuss the need for a fundamental, system-wide change across technological, economic and social factors, including changing paradigms, goals and values. to achieve this, we must move away from looking at biodiversity as a production factor to seeing it as an integral part of life, without which we cannot survive. moving from an economy of exploitation to an economy of restoration will require individual and collective behavioural change.

the closing plenary will be opened by elizabeth mrema, executive secretary of the cbd and will start with a conversation between christiane paulus, director general at bmu, carla montesi, director at devco and carlos rodriguez, ceo of gef, before moving to a dynamic panel of representatives from youth, government, business, civil society and indigenous people.
participants will join the discussion and contribute to the transformative change which we will initiate here.

"217","Oceans contain a wealth of biodiversity","https://www.cbd.int/marine/, https://www.cbd.int/soi/about","oceans cover 70% of our planet and represent over 95% of the biosphere. marine and coastal habitats cover a diverse spectrum<U+0097>from those near terrestrial environments such as coral reefs, mangrove forests, seagrass beds and estuaries, to those deep below the surface, such as open ocean, hydrothermal vents, seamounts and soft sediments on the ocean floor.

more than just a valuable source of food and various economic activities, the ocean is one of the largest natural reservoirs of carbon. it stores about 15 times more co2 than the terrestrial biosphere and soils, and plays a significant role in climate moderation.
deep-seabed habitats host between 500,000 and 10 million species. deep-sea life is essential to life on earth because of its crucial role in global carbon and biogeochemical cycles, including nutrient regeneration.

this tremendous wealth of biodiversity and ecosystem services is not, however, infinite. today, human activities are greatly threatening the seas and coasts through overfishing, destructive fishing practices, pollution and waste disposal, agricultural runoff, invasive alien species, and habitat destruction. global climate change adds additional pressures by raising the sea level, increasing the water temperature and leading to more storms and natural disasters. seawater is acidifying due to increasing levels of atmospheric co2, with significant implications for marine biodiversity.

countries that adopted the convention on biological diversity are addressing various challenges to the conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal biodiversity. by applying the ecosystem and precautionary approaches, they focus on the integrated management of marine and coastal areas, protection and enhanced management of ecologically or biologically significant areas, and sustainable fishery and mariculture management.

2020 theme: housing for all <U+0097> a better urban future

having an adequate home is now, more than ever, a matter of life and death. as covid-19 continues to spread, people have been told to stay at home, but this simple measure is impossible for people who do not have adequate housing.

world habitat day 2020 presents the opportunity to engage in a global discussion on the transformative impact of covid-19 on the housing sector and to explore how to build societies back better, by leveraging the role of housing as a catalyst for progressively delivering human rights and as a foundation of people<U+0092>s wellbeing. issues around housing must be at the centre of sustainable and inclusive urban development. covid-19 has brought the housing paradox into sharp relief <U+0096> at a time when people are in urgent need of shelter, millions of apartments and houses sit empty.

inclusive, affordable and adequate housing is the key to sustainable transformation of our cities and communities. sustainable development goal 11 aims for resilient, inclusive, safe, diverse cities by 2030 and one of the targets is access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services for all by 2030 and the upgrade of slum. the pandemic offers new opportunities for all stakeholders to participate.

wild biodiversity has an important role in contributing to food production and security in many agroecosystems worldwide.  wild foods include varied forms of both plant and animal products, ranging from fruits, leafy vegetables, woody foliage, bulbs and tubers, cereals and grains, nuts and kernels, saps and gums (which are eaten or used to make drinks), mushrooms, to invertebrates such as insects and snails, honey, bird eggs, bushmeat from small and large vertebrates, reptiles, birds, fish and shellfish. these examples reflect broad groups and not the dozens of species included within each wild food type. these various wild foods add diversity to the diets of people and communities who make extensive use of them.

the different crop varieties and animal breeds used in agriculture around the world are based on the world<U+0092>s genetic diversity. in addition, biodiversity directly supports agriculture systems by helping to ensure soil fertility, pollination and pest control. for these reasons, biodiversity is key for producing food for a growing world population. biodiversity is crucial to the reduction of poverty, due to the basic goods and ecosystem services it provides. biodiversity must therefore be protected and sustainably used for achieving poverty reduction and sustainable development.
